Bereshith
1
1:1	In the beginning of the creation by G d [Elokim, the attribute of justice,] of the heavens and the earth, [G d first intending to create the world with the attribute of justice but then granting precedence to the attribute of mercy (Yod-Key-Vav-Key), seeing that the world could not otherwise endure],
1:2	the earth was vacuous and void, and there was darkness upon the face of the deep [i.e., the waters], and the d"wind of G d" [the Throne of Glory, impelled by His utterance] hovered over the face of the waters.
1:3	And G d said: Let there be light! And there was light.
1:4	And G d saw that the light was good, [and that it was not appropriate for light and darkness to serve in combination] and G d separated between the light and the darkness, [making the day the domain of the first and the night the domain of the second].
1:5	And G d called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And it was evening and it was morning, the day of the One, [the angels not being created until the second day].
1:6	And G d said: Let there be a firmament [i.e., let the firmament be hardened] in the midst of the waters, [the upper waters being at a distance from the firmament just as the lower waters are], and let it divide between waters and waters.
1:7	And G d made [i.e., fixed in place] the firmament, and He divided between the waters below the firmament and the waters above the firmament; and it was so.
1:8	And G d called the firmament shamayim [sa mayim - it "carries" water (the upper waters); sham mayim - water is there; esh umayim - fire and water (the firmament being a combination of the two)]. And it was evening, and it was morning, the second day.
1:9	And G d said: Let the waters below the heavens, [which were spread over the entire earth], be gathered into one place [the ocean], and let the dry land be seen; and it was so.
1:10	And G d called the dry land "earth," and the gathering of the waters He called "seas" [(plural, fish from different regions of the sea having distinctive tastes)], and G d saw that it was good, [the "work of the waters" being completed on that day].
1:11	And G d said: Let the earth put forth [a blanket of] herbage, grass yielding seed, fruit-tree, [the tree tasting like the fruit], giving fruit of its kind, whose seed is in it [to grow a tree of the same kind] upon the earth; and it was so.
1:12	And the earth put forth herbage, grass yielding seed according to its kind [though not having been commanded to do so], and tree giving fruit [(but not "fruit-tree" as commanded (11), for which the earth was subsequently punished, together with Adam)], whose seed is in it according to its kind. And G d saw that it was good.
1:13	And it was evening, and it was morning, the third day.
1:14	And G d said: Let there be [suspended] luminaries in the firmament of the heaven [(The luminaries, like all things pertaining to heaven and to earth, had been created on the first day, but each of the particular creations was activated on its particular day.)] to divide between the day and the night, [after the first light had been secreted for the righteous for the world to come.] And let them serve for signs [(eclipses being omens of ill)], and for festivals, [reckoned by the New Moon], and for days, [the sun and the moon serving for half a day respectively], and for years, [completing their course through the zodiac in 365 days].
1:15	And let them [in addition] be luminaries in the firmament of the heaven to illuminate the earth; and it was so.
1:16	And G d made the two great luminaries [(They were created of equal size, but when the moon protested "two kings reigning with one crown," it was diminished)], the great luminary for governance of the day, and the small luminary for governance of the night, and the stars, [(G d multiplying the moon's hosts to "appease" it for its diminution)].
1:17	And G d set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth.
1:18	And to rule by day and by night, and to divide between the light and the darkness. And G d saw that it was good.
1:19	And it was evening, and it was morning, the fourth day.
1:20	And G d said: Let the waters swarm a swarming (sheretz) [creatures not higher than the ground (e.g., flies, worms, rodents, fish)] infused with life, and birds flying above the earth on the face of the firmament of heaven.
1:21	And G d created the leviathans and all the creeping life-infused creatures, swarmed by the waters according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind, and G d saw that it was good.
1:22	And G d blessed them, saying: Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply in the earth.
1:23	And it was evening, and it was morning, the fifth day.
1:24	And G d said: Let the earth bring forth [(it already having been created on the first day)] (every) life-infused creature according to its kind: beast, creeping thing, and animal of the earth according to its kind; and it was so. [It was fully formed.]
1:25	And G d made [fully formed] (every) animal of the earth according to its kind and (every) beast according to its kind, and creeping thing according to its kind; and G d saw that it was good.
1:26	And G d said: Let us make man [(G d in His humility "asking leave" of the angels)] in our image according to our likeness [to understand and to know], and yirdu [connoting "they shall have dominion over" (if they are virtuous) or (if they are not), "they shall be humbled before"] the fish of the sea, the birds of the heaven, the beasts, and all the earth, and all the creeping things that creep on the earth.
1:27	And G d created the man in his mould [that He had cast for him (Adam, as opposed to the other creations, being created by "hand" and not by pronouncement)]; in the image of G d He created him; male and female He created them [on the sixth day, forming Eve from Adam's side].
1:28	And G d blessed them, and G d said to them: Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it [(also readable as "subdue her," connoting both that the mitzvah of procreation is his and not hers, and that he is to keep her from being "free" with herself)], and have dominion over the fish of the sea and the birds of the heaven, and over all the animals that range the earth.
1:29	And G d said: Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed upon the face of the earth and every tree which has in it fruit of a tree, bearing seed. To you shall it be for food, [man not being permitted to kill animals for food until after the flood].
1:30	And to all the animals of the earth and to all the birds of heaven, and to all that creeps upon the earth, which has a living soul, (I have given) every green herb for food. And it was so.
1:31	And G d saw all that He had made, and, behold, it was very good; and it was evening and it was morning the [hah] sixth day, [(signaling acceptance of the five (heh) books of the Law as a sine qua non for the creation)].
2
2:1	And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all of their hosts.
2:2	And G d completed on [i.e., precisely upon the advent of] the seventh day His work that He had done, and He rested on the seventh day, from all the work that He had done.
2:3	And G d blessed the seventh day [through the manna (a presage of the future), double the normal amount being provided on the sixth day], and He sanctified it, [through the manna, none falling on the Sabbath], for on it He rested from all of His work which the L rd had created to do. [i.e., What was to have been done on the Sabbath was done on the sixth day, the work of that day being doubled.]
2:4	These [the above-mentioned] are the engenderings of the heaven and the earth, when they were created, on the day the L rd G d made earth and heaven [(whence it is derived that they were all created on the first day (see 1:14)].
2:5	And every plant of the field was not yet in the earth, and every grass of the field had not yet sprouted [above the ground (the third-day sprouting (12) remaining beneath the surface)], for the L rd G d [(the first, Yod-Key-Vav-Key, being His name; the second, Elokim, connoting Ruler and Judge)] had not yet caused it to rain upon the earth, for there was no man to work the ground [and to appreciate the rain, until Adam was created, who recognized that rain was needed for the world, prayed for it, and "secured" it].
2:6	And [for the creation of man (1:27)] a vapor rose from the earth and watered the entire face of the ground, [water, as it were, being added to the "dough" for the "kneading" of man].
2:7	And the L rd G d formed (vayitzer) [two yods for two "formings," one for this world, one for the resurrection (as opposed to the creation of the beasts (19), where only one yod is written)] the man, dust from the [four corners of the] earth. And He blew into his nostrils a soul of life, and man became a vital soul, [having speech and understanding (as opposed to the beasts)].
2:8	And the L rd G d planted a garden in Eden from the east, and He placed there the man that He had formed.
2:9	And the L rd G d caused to sprout from the ground [in the garden of Eden] every tree desirable to the sight and good for eating, and the tree of life in the very midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
2:10	And a river goes out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it parts and becomes four heads.
2:11	The name of the first, Pishon ["the bountiful" (the Nile)]. It is that which goes round the entire land of Chavilah, where there is gold.
2:12	And the gold of that land is good. There is the bedollach and the onyx stone.
2:13	And the name of the second river, Gichon ["roaring"]. It is that which goes round the entire land of Kush.
2:14	And the name of the third river, Chidekel [so called because its waters are pungent (chad) and light (kal)]. It is that which goes east of Ashur. And the fourth river, Perath ["waxing" (the most distinctive of all, being mentioned in conjunction with Eretz Yisrael (see Deuteronomy 1:7)].
2:15	And the L rd G d "took" the man [with pleasant, enticing words], and He placed him in the garden of Eden to work it and to guard it.
2:16	And the L rd G d commanded the man, saying: Of every tree of the garden you may eat.
2:17	But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat. For on the day that you eat of it you shall die.
2:18	And the L rd G d said: It is not good that the man be alone [and "one" (i.e., unique in having no mate) among the terrestrial creatures, as the L rd is One among the celestial creatures — two deities, as it were]; I shall make him a help [(If he merits it, she is a help)], against him [(If he does not merit it, she is against him, contending with him)]. [(see 2:20)]
2:19	And the L rd G d formed from the earth all of the animals of the field [(same as 1:25)] and [also] all of the birds of the heavens, [forming them from slime (a combination of water (1:20) and earth)], and He brought (them) [on the very same day] to the man to see what he would call them. And every living creature that the man named — that is its name [forever].
2:20	And the man named every beast and bird of heaven and all the animals of the field [and saw that each had its mate], but for the man he did not find a help against him. [(see 2:18)]
2:21	And the L rd G d cast a deep sleep upon the man and he slept. And He took one of his sides and He closed it up [the incision site] with flesh beneath it.
2:22	And the L rd G d fashioned the side that He had taken from the man into a woman, ["building" her broad beneath and narrow above (like a wheat bin) so that the fetus not weigh down too heavily upon her sides], and He brought her to the man.
2:23	And the man said: This time [(Adam having lived with every beast and not having found gratification)], bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. This shall be called ishah (woman), for from ish (man) was this taken [(whence it is derived that the world was created with the holy tongue)].
2:24	Therefore, [(the Divine Spirit speaking, interdicting illicit relations to the Noachides)], a man shall leave his father and his mother and cleave to his wife, and they shall become one flesh [in their child, who is formed from both].
2:25	And both of them were naked, the man and his wife, and they were not ashamed, [for they did not know the way of modesty, to distinguish between good and evil, until they had eaten of the tree of knowledge (of good and evil)].
3
3:1	And the serpent was more subtle than all the animals of the field that the L rd G d had made, and [seeing them naked and copulating openly, and desiring her,] he said to the woman: Can it be that G d has said: You shall not eat of all the trees of the garden? [speaking thus though seeing them eating from all the other trees, in order to turn the subject to that tree].
3:2	And the woman said to the serpent: Of the fruit of the trees of the garden, we may eat.
3:3	And from the fruit of the tree in the midst of the garden, G d said: You shall not eat of it and you shall not touch it, [(Eve "sealing her 'destruction' by her 'addition'")] lest you die.
3:4	And the serpent said to the woman: you shall not die. [He pushed her until she touched the tree and said to her: Just as there is no death in touching it, there is no death in eating from it.]
3:5	For G d knows that on the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like G d [creators of worlds], knowing good and evil. [i.e., G d ate of it and created the world, and you, likewise, will be creators of worlds by eating of it. Knowing this, and desiring "exclusivity," He forbids it to you.]
3:6	And the woman saw [i.e., she espoused the words of the serpent] that the tree was good for eating, [making one like G d], and that it was desirable for the eyes, [viz.: "your eyes will be opened"], and that the tree was auspicious for knowing [viz.: "knowing good and evil"], and she took of its fruit and she ate, and she gave also to her husband with her [so that she not die and he live and marry another], and he ate.
3:7	And the eyes of both were opened and they knew that they were naked [bereft of their one mitzvah], and they put together fig leaves and made themselves girdles. [(The tree of knowledge was a fig tree. "Wherein they offended, they were amended.")]
3:8	And they heard the voice of the L rd G d sounding in the garden in the direction of (the descent of) the sun, [i.e., the west], and the man and his wife hid before the L rd G d in the midst of the trees of the garden.
3:9	And the L rd G d called to the man, and He said to him: "Where are You?" [this, in order to give him time to collect himself]
3:10	And he said: I heard Your voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked, and I hid.
3:11	And He said: Who told you that you were naked? [i.e., Where did you learn to be ashamed of your nakedness?] Did you eat of the tree from which I bade you not to eat?
3:12	And the man said: The woman that You gave with me, [(Adam here denies G d's boon)] — she gave me of the tree and I ate.
3:13	And the L rd G d said to the woman: What is this that you have done? And the woman said: The serpent deceived me and I ate.
3:14	And the L rd G d said to the serpent: Because you did this, you are more accursed than all the beasts and all the animals of the field. On your belly shall you go, and dust shall you eat all the days of your life.
3:15	And hatred shall I place between you and between the woman, [whom you seduced with your wiles] and between your seed and her seed. He will crush your head and you will hiss at his heel [to bite him].
3:16	To the woman He said: I shall increase your distress [in rearing children] and your [pain in] pregnancy. In travail shall you bear children, and to your husband shall be your desire [for cohabitation, in spite of which you will not have the boldness to solicit him verbally], and he shall "rule" over you [in this regard].
3:17	And to the man he said: Because you heeded your wife's voice and ate of the tree whereof I commanded you not to eat, cursed is the earth [(whence you were begotten)] for you. [(It shall spawn "accursed" things for you, like flies, fleas and ants)]. In toil shall you eat of it all the days of your life.
3:18	And thorns and thistles [artichokes and cardoon (which can be eaten only with special preparation)] will it sprout for you [when you sow it], and you will eat the herbs of the field.
3:19	With the sweat of your brow shall you eat bread until you return to the ground. For from it were you taken. For dust you are and to dust you will return.
3:20	And [(reversion to 2:20, "And the man named every beast, etc.")] the man called his wife Chavah ["vivifying"], for she was the mother of all the living.
3:21	And the L rd G d made for the man and his wife skin-vestments and He clothed them.
3:22	And the L rd G d said: Behold, man has become like one of us [(He is unique among the terrestrial creations as I am unique among the celestial. And what is his uniqueness?)] knowing good and evil [(such knowledge not obtaining with beasts and animals)]. And now, perhaps he will put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever [and draw the other creatures after him to regard him as a deity].
3:23	And He drove out the man, and He set east of the garden of Eden the cherubs [angels of destruction] and the flash of the revolving sword [(to intimidate him against re-entering)] to guard the path of the tree of life.
4
4:1	And the man had known Chavah his wife and she had conceived and had borne [(even before the episode of the tree of knowledge)], [a twin girl] with Cain. And she said: "I have acquired [(kanithi, like "Cain")] a man with the L rd" [(my husband and I being "partners" with Him in the creation of Cain)].
4:2	And she bore again [(a twin sister)] with his brother, with [(i.e., another twin sister, with)] Abel. And Abel was a shepherd, and Cain was a tiller of the soil.
4:3	And it was, after some time, that Cain brought of the fruits [(of the poorest of them)] of the ground, a gift to the L rd.
4:4	And Abel brought — he, too — of the first-born of his flock and of their fats. And the L rd turned to Abel and to his gift. [Fire descended (from heaven) and consumed his offering.]
4:5	And to Cain and to his gift He did not turn. And Cain was sorely wroth, and his face fell.
4:6	And the L rd said to Cain: Why are you wroth, and why is your face fallen?
4:7	If you make amends, will you not be forgiven? And if you do not make amends, at the opening [of your grave] your sin lies [i.e., is preserved], and to you is its [the evil inclination's] desire [to lead you astray]; but you can rule over it.
4:8	And Cain spoke to Abel, [contentiously, seeking a pretext to kill him], and it was, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.
4:9	And the L rd said to Cain [(gently, by way of "preparing" him)]: "Where is Abel your brother?" And he said [(negating Divine omniscience)]: "I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?"
4:10	And He said: What have you done? The voice of your brother's bloods [his blood and that of his unborn children] are crying out to Me from the ground.
4:11	And, now, you shall be cursed more than the earth [has already been cursed for its sin (see 1:12). And in this, too, it has continued to sin —] in that it has opened its mouth to take your brother's bloods from your hand.
4:12	[(the additional curse:)] When you till the soil, it shall no longer give her strength to you. A vagabond and a wanderer shall you be in the land, [not being permitted to live in one place].
4:13	And Cain said to the L rd: "Is my sin too great [for You, the 'bearer' of heaven and earth] to bear?"
4:14	Behold, You have driven me this day from the face of the ground, and from Your face shall I be hid, and I shall be a vagabond and a wanderer in the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.
4:15	And the L rd said to him: Therefore, whoever kills Cain … At the end of seven [generations] it shall be avenged (see 24). And the L rd made for Cain a sign that he not be smitten by any who find him.
4:16	And Cain went forth from before the L rd [in assumed humility] and he dwelt in the land of Nod [whither all the exiles betake themselves ("nadim")] east of Eden [where his father was exiled (3:24) and where (in the east) the cities of refuge are located (Deuteronomy 4:41)].
4:17	And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and she bore Chanoch. And he built a city, and he called the name of the city after the name of his son Chanoch [as a memorial to him].
4:18	And Irad was born to Chanoch, and Irad begot Mechuyael, and Mechiyael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech.
4:19	And Lamech took for himself two wives [(all of this being mentioned as bearing out "at the end of seven generations" (15)], the name of the first, Adah, and the name of the second, Tzilah.
4:20	And Adah bore Yaval. He was the father of those who dwell in tents raising cattle, [moving from place to place for fresh pasture].
4:21	And the name of his brother was Yuval. He was the father of all who play harp and pipe.
4:22	And Tzilah — she, too, bore Tuval-Cain [lit., "refiner of Cain" (i.e., of his trade — murder)], forging all tools of copper and iron. And the sister of Tuval-Cain was Na'amah.
4:23	And Lemech said to his wives, Adah and Tzilah, [who had separated from him after he had (unwittingly) killed Cain and Tuval-Cain:] Hear my voice, wives of Lemech. Heed my speech. Did I kill a man [Cain] by my [wilfully inflicted] wound, and a child [Tuval-Cain] by my blow?
4:24	If Cain, [who killed wilfully,] were avenged [only after] seven generations, should Lemech, [who killed unwittingly, not be granted] seventy and seven!
4:25	And Adam knew his wife again [after having reproached Lemech's wives for separating from their husbands, and having himself been reproached for separating from Eve after death was decreed for mankind], and she bore a son, and she called his name Sheth; for (she said) G d set (shath) for me other seed in place of Abel whom Cain killed.
4:26	And unto Sheth, too, was born a son, and he called his name Enosh. Then [men and images] were called profanely in the name of the L rd, [being rendered deities].
5
5:1	This is the numeration of the generations of Adam on the day G d created man [(Adam begetting on the day he was born)]. In the likeness of G d He made him.
5:2	Male and female He created them. And He blessed them, and He called their name Adam on the day He created them.
5:3	And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years [after having separated from Eve], and he (then) begot (a son) in his likeness according to his image, and he called his name Sheth.
5:4	And the days of Adam after he begot Sheth were eight hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.
5:5	And all the days of Adam, which he lived, were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.
5:6	And Sheth lived a hundred and five years and he begot Enosh.
5:7	And Sheth lived, after he begot Enosh, eight hundred and seven years, and he begot sons and daughters.
5:8	And all the days of Sheth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.
5:9	And Enosh lived ninety years and he begot Keinan.
5:10	And Enosh lived, after he begot Keinan, eight hundred and fifteen years, and he begot sons and daughters.
5:11	And all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years, and he died.
5:12	And Keinan lived seventy years and he begot Mahalalel.
5:13	And Keinan lived, after he begot Mahalalel, eight hundred and forty years, and he begot sons and daughters.
5:14	And all the days of Keinan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.
5:15	And Mahalalel lived sixty-five years and he begot Yared.
5:16	And Mahalalel lived, after he begot Yared, eight hundred and thirty years, and he begot sons and daughters.
5:17	And all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he died.
5:18	And Yered lived a hundred and sixty-two years and he begot Chanoch.
5:19	And Yered lived, after he begot Chanoch, eight hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.
5:20	And all the days of Yered were nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died.
5:21	And Chanoch lived sixty-five years and he begot Methuselah.
5:22	And Chanoch walked with G d after he begot Methuselah three hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.
5:23	And all the days of Chanoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.
5:24	And Chanoch walked with G d, and he was not, for G d took him [before his time, so that he not depart from his righteousness.]
5:25	And Methuselah lived a hundred and eighty-seven years and he begot Lamech.
5:26	And Methuselah lived, after he begot Lemech, seven hundred and eighty-two years, and he begot sons and daughters.
5:27	And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died.
5:28	And Lemech lived a hundred and eighty-two years and he begot a son [ben, from whom the world was built (nivneh)].
5:29	And he called his name Noach, saying: This one will "ease us" (yenachamenu) of our deeds and of the toil of our hands from the earth, which the L rd cursed, [(Noach providing plowing tools for them, and the earth ceasing to sprout thorns and thistles whenever they sowed wheat)].
5:30	And Lemech lived, after he begot Noach, five hundred and ninety-five years, and he begot sons and daughters.
5:31	And all the days of Lemech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died.
5:32	And Noach was five hundred years old [(G d keeping him from begetting until then so that none of his sons reach the (then) age of punishment (100) before the flood.)] And Noach begot Shem, Cham, and Yafeth [(Shem, the righteous one, born circumcised, the progenitor of Abraham, being mentioned first, though Yefeth was the oldest.)]
6
6:1	And it was, when men began to multiply upon the face of the earth and daughters were born to them,
6:2	that the sons of the nobles saw the daughters of men when they were adorned [to be wed, at which time one of them cohabited with her first], and they took for themselves consorts of all that they chose, [even by way of adultery, even by way of sodomy].
6:3	And the L rd said: My spirit shall not contend [in Me] forever [i.e., interminably] concerning man, [whether or not to destroy him,] in that [this,] too, [is in him, that] he is flesh, [and not a hard substance — and even so he does not humble himself before Me!] and his days shall be one hundred and twenty years, [at which time, if he has not repented, I shall bring a flood.]
6:4	The Nefilim [those who fell (naflu) and who overthrew (hipilu) the world] were in the land in those days [the days of the generation of Enosh and the sons of Cain], and also afterwards [(after they had seen a third of the world flooded in the days of Enosh and should have repented of their ways)], when the sons of the nobles came to (i.e., lived with) the daughters of men, who bore unto them [giants like them]. They are the "mighty ones" [in rebelling against the L rd]; of yore, men of name [(their names alluding to their future downfall, e.g., "Irad," "Mechuyael," Methushael" (4:18), all connoting destruction)].
6:5	And the L rd saw that the evil of man was great in the earth and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the day.
6:6	And the L rd was comforted that He had made man on earth, [and not in heaven, where he would have incited the celestial creatures to rebellion], and He thought to scourge him.
6:7	And the L rd said: I will blot out the man that I have created from off the face of the earth [He is earth and I shall blot him out with water] — from man until beast [(The beasts, too, had corrupted their ways)] until creeping thing and bird of the heavens; for I have bethought Myself [of what to do] for having made them.
6:8	And Noach found favor in the eyes of the L rd.
Noach
6:9	These are the progeny of Noach. [(Noach's name having been mentioned, "The remembrance of the righteous is for blessing," viz.:)] Noach was a righteous man; perfect was he in his generations. With G d [i.e., with His support] Noach walked.
6:10	And Noach begot three sons: Shem, Cham, and Yafeth.
6:11	And the earth became corrupt [(with illicit relations and idolatry)] before G d, and the earth was filled with theft.
6:12	And G d beheld the earth, and, behold, it had become corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth, [even beasts, animals, and birds mating outside of their kind].
6:13	And G d said to Noach: The end of all flesh has come before Me, [illicit relations and idolatry bringing "promiscuous" destruction to the world], for the earth is filled with theft through them, [theft "sealing" their decree], and, behold, I shall destroy them from the earth.
6:14	Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood. [Measured] compartments shall you make in the ark, and you shall pitch it inside and outside with pitch [against the turbulent waters].
6:15	And this is how you shall make it: three hundred cubits, the length of the ark; fifty cubits, its width; and thirty cubits, its height.
6:16	A window shall you make for the ark. To a cubit shall you finish it above, [the roof slanting upwards to a cubit so that the water would run down its sides], and the door of the ark shall you place in its side, [so that the rain not enter it]. Lower stories [for dung], middle stories [for animals], and third stories [for men] shall you make it.
6:17	And, behold, I shall bring the deluge [(in concession to the angels' "What is man that You are mindful of him?")], waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh that has in it a spirit of life from under the heavens. All that is on the earth shall perish.
6:18	And I shall establish My covenant with you [(a "covenant" being needed so that the food not decay and so that the wicked ones of the generation not kill him)]. And you shall come to the ark; you and your sons, and your wife and the wives of your sons with you [(men and women separately, cohabitation being forbidden to them in the ark)].
6:19	And of all that lives [(including demons)], of all flesh, [at least] two [male and female] of all [even of the least numerous] shall you bring to the ark to keep alive with you. Male and female shall they be.
6:20	Of birds [who had mated] according to their kind [and not promiscuously] and of beasts according to their kind, of all the creeping things of the ground, according to their kind — two of all shall come to you to keep alive, [(all coming, the ark admitting only those which had mated with their kind, and Noach taking two of these)].
6:21	And you, take for yourself all of the food that is to be eaten, and gather it unto you, and it shall be for you and for them to eat.
6:22	And Noach did [i.e., built] as all that G d commanded him; thus did he do.
7
7:1	And the L rd said to Noach: Come, you and all your household into the ark; for you have I seen to be righteous before Me in this generation [(as opposed to "perfectly righteous" (6:9), only part of a man's praises being stated to his face)].
7:2	Of all the beasts that are [destined to be pronounced] clean [to Israel (whence it follows that Noach studied Torah)], take for yourself seven, seven, male and female, [some to be sacrificed upon leaving the ark], and of the beasts which are not clean, two, male and female.
7:3	Also, of the [clean] birds of heaven, seven, seven, male and female, to sustain seed on the face of all the earth.
7:4	For in an additional seven days [seven days of mourning in honor of Methuselah, in addition to the 120 year grace period], I shall bring down rain upon the earth, forty days and forty nights [(retribution for constraining the L rd to form bastard embryos, (forty days being the formation period)], and I shall blot out every being that I have made from the face of the earth.
7:5	And Noach did as all that the L rd had commanded him, [in entering the ark].
7:6	And Noach was six hundred years old when the deluge was water upon the earth.
7:7	And Noach and his sons, and his wife, and the wives of his sons with him, entered the ark [(men and women separately, cohabitation being forbidden because of the world's affliction)] in the face of the waters of the deluge, [(even Noach being one of the "small in faith," not entering until actually being "pushed" by the waters)].
7:8	Of the clean beast and of the beast which is not clean and of the fowl and all that creeps upon the ground.
7:9	Two, two [(at the least)] they came to Noach to the ark, male and female, as G d had commanded Noach.
7:10	And it was, after the seven days, that the waters of the deluge were upon the earth.
7:11	In the six hundredth year of Noach's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month — on this day, all the fountains of the great deep burst, and the windows of heaven were opened.
7:12	And the rain was on the earth forty days and forty nights [(G d bringing it down first as "merciful" rain pending their repentance, which, not forthcoming, it was changed to a flood (17)].
7:13	On this very day, [in plain sight, in defiance of the wicked ones who said: If we see him entering the ark we will kill him], Noach, and Shem, Cham, and Yefeth, the sons of Noach, and the wife of Noach, and the three wives of his sons with them, came to the ark.
7:14	They, and every animal according to its kind, and every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth according to its kind, and every flying thing according to its kind, every bird of every [type of] wing, [including locusts].
7:15	And they came to Noach to the ark, two, two, of all flesh which had in it the spirit of life.
7:16	And those who came, male and female of all flesh came, as G d had commanded him, and the L rd closed up [the ark] for him [against the waters].
7:17	And the flood was on the earth forty days, and the waters increased and bore up the ark, and it was lifted above the earth.
7:18	And the waters grew stronger and increased greatly upon the earth, and the ark moved on the face of the waters.
7:19	And the waters grew exceedingly stronger upon the earth, and all the high mountains under all of the heavens were covered.
7:20	The waters grew stronger [until they were] fifteen cubits above [the mountains], and the mountains were covered.
7:21	And all the flesh died that moved upon the ground, in bird, beast, and animal, and in all creeping things that creep on the ground, and all men (died).
7:22	Whatever had the breath of the spirit of life in its nostrils, of all that was on the dry land, died, [but not the fish in the sea].
7:23	And He blotted out every being upon the face of the ground — from man until beast until creeping thing until bird of heaven. And they were blotted out from the earth, and there remained only Noach and those with him in the ark.
7:24	And the waters grew stronger upon the earth, a hundred and fifty days.
8
8:1	And G d [(Elokim, the attribute of justice, having been transmuted to that of mercy by Noach's prayers)] remembered Noach and all of the animals, and all of the beasts which were with him in the ark, [G d "remembering" in their behalf that they had not corrupted their ways (by mating with different species) and that they had not mated in the ark], and G d passed [before Him] a spirit [of conciliation and easement] over the ["affairs" of] the earth, and the waters receded.
8:2	And the fountains of the deep were dammed up [(not all the fountains as in 7:11; those needed for the continuation of the world were left open)] and the openings of heaven; and the rain was withheld from the heavens.
8:3	And the waters started returning from upon the earth, and the waters began receding at the end of a hundred and fifty days [on the first of Sivan].
8:4	And the ark rested in [Sivan] the seventh month [after Kislev, when the rains had stopped falling], on the seventeenth day of the month, on Mount Ararat.
8:5	And the waters kept on receding until [Av] the tenth month [after the beginning of the rain in Marcheshvan]. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.
8:6	And it was at the end of forty days [from when the tops of the mountains were seen] that Noach opened the window [i.e., the skylight] of the ark that he had made.
8:7	And he sent the raven, and it went out and circled [(the ark, not executing its mission, suspecting Noach of designs upon its mate)], until the waters had dried off from the earth.
8:8	And he sent away the dove from him [after seven days] to see if the waters had "lightened" from the face of the ground.
8:9	And the dove found no rest for the sole of its foot, and it returned to him to the ark, for waters were on the face of the whole earth. And he sent forth his hand and he took it and he brought it to him to the ark.
8:10	And he waited yet another seven days, and he again sent forth the dove from the ark.
8:11	And the dove came to him towards evening, and, behold, it had torn an olive leaf with its beak, and Noach knew that the waters had lightened from off the earth.
8:12	And he held off another seven days, and he sent the dove, and it did not return to him again.
8:13	And it was in the six hundred and first year (of Noach's life), in the first month [of the year], on the first day of the month, that the water dried from off the earth, and Noach removed the covering of the ark, and, behold, the face of the earth had become (somewhat) hardened.
8:14	And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, [exactly one solar year after the beginning of the flood (see 7:11), this being the duration of the punishment of the generation of the flood], the earth dried up [i.e., it returned to its normal state].
8:15	And G d spoke to Noach, saying:
8:16	Go out of the ark — you and your wife, [cohabitation now being permitted (see 7:7)], and your sons and the wives of your sons with you.
8:17	Every animal that is with you, of all flesh, of bird and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth haytzeh ["Tell them to go out" (this, the spoken form), or hotzeh, "Take them out" (by force, if they refuse to leave — this, the written form)] with you, and they shall teem in the earth, [but not in the ark (whence it is seen that even the beasts and the birds were forbidden to mate there)], and they shall be fruitful and shall multiply upon the earth.
8:18	And there went out Noach and his sons and his wife, and the wives of his sons with him.
8:19	Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird — every thing that creeps upon the earth, according to their families [(They took upon themselves to mate only with their kind)] went out of the ark.
8:20	And Noach built an altar to the L rd, and he took of all the clean beasts and of all the clean birds and he offered up burnt-offerings upon the altar, [reasoning that he had been commanded to bring "seven, seven" of those (7:2) only so that he might offer sacrifices].
8:21	And the L rd smelled the fragrant odor, and the L rd said within His heart: I shall not again curse the ground for the sake of man. For the inclination of man's heart is evil from his youth [(min'eurav, lit., from the time he "bestirs" himself (to leave his mother's womb)], and I shall not again [(repetition constituting an oath)] smite all living things as I have done.
8:22	No more shall cease, all the days of the earth, seed-time [half of Tishrei, Marcheshvan, and half of Kislev], and harvest-time [half of Nissan, Iyyar, and half of Sivan], cold-season [half of Kislev, Teveth, and half of Shvat], and hot season [half of Av, Elul, and half of Tishrei], summer-fruit season [half of Sivan, Tammuz, and half of Av], and winter-fruit season [half of Shvat, Adar, and half of Nissan], and day and night [shall not cease (whence it is seen that all the days of the flood they did cease)].
9
9:1	And G d blessed Noach and his sons, and He said to them: Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.
9:2	And your dread and your awe shall be upon all the animals of the earth and on all the birds of the heaven, on all that moves upon the earth and on all the fish of the sea; into your hand are they given.
9:3	Every creeping thing that lives shall be for you to eat. As green herbs [which alone, I permitted to Adam], to you have I given all.
9:4	Only, you shall not eat flesh with its life [(the ban on ever min hachai — flesh torn from a living animal)] — blood [(the ban on blood from a living animal)].
9:5	But [though I have permitted you to take the life of a beast], I shall require your blood [(if you take your life)] for your lives [even if you do not spill blood, (e.g., strangulation)]. From the hand of every animal will I [now] require it, [the men of the generation of the flood having been consigned as prey to the beasts], and from the hand of man [one who kills wilfully, in the absence of witnesses], from the hand of a man [against one he loves as] his brother, [whom he kills unwittingly, in the absence of witnesses to make him liable to exile, and in the absence of contrition and penance on his part], I shall require the life of a man.
9:6	One who spills the blood of man [in the presence of witnesses], by man shall his blood be spilled. [Why so?] For in the image of G d did He make man.
9:7	And you, be fruitful and multiply, [(this being stated originally (9:1) as a blessing, and here, as a command)], teem in the earth and increase in it.
9:8	And G d said to Noach and to his sons with him, saying:
9:9	And I, behold, [I concur with you in your apprehension of begetting children (with the threat of another deluge looming over them) and] I am establishing My covenant with you [not to destroy you], and with your seed after you.
9:10	And with all living things that are with you, of bird and beast, and of all the animals of the earth that are ["compatible"] with you, of all that leave the ark [including reptiles and creeping things], of all the animals of the earth [including mazikkin ("injurers")].
9:11	And I will confirm [through the sign of the rainbow] My covenant with you, and no flesh will again be cut off by the waters of the deluge, and there will not again be a deluge to destroy the earth.
9:12	And G d said: This is the sign of the covenant that I give between Me and you and between every living soul that is with you for the generations [(doroth, written defective, some generations of righteous men not requiring a sign)] forever.
9:13	My bow have I set in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth.
9:14	And it will be, when I "cloud a cloud" upon the earth [i.e., when it enters My mind to bring darkness and destruction to the world], then the bow will be seen in the cloud.
9:15	And I shall remember My covenant between Me and you and between every living thing of all flesh, and the waters will no more be a deluge to destroy all flesh.
9:16	And the bow will be in the cloud and I will see it, to remember the eternal covenant between G d [Elokim — the Attribute of Justice] and between every living soul in all flesh upon the earth.
9:17	And G d said to Noach [showing him the bow]: This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between Me and between all flesh that is on the earth.
9:18	And the sons of Noach who went out of the ark were Shem, Cham, and Yefeth; and Cham was the father of Canaan [(the relationship being mentioned here to shed light on what is to follow vis-à-vis the cursing of Cham and Canaan)].
9:19	These three are the sons of Noach, and from these did the whole earth spread.
9:20	And Noach profaned himself, the lord of the ground, and he planted a vineyard. [He should have planted something else first.]
9:21	And he drank from the wine and he was inebriated and he uncovered himself in the midst of his tent [ahalo, written "ahalah," an allusion to the ten tribes, called by the name of Shomron (Ahalah), who were exiled because of overindulgence in wine].
9:22	And Cham the father of Canaan saw [(Some say Canaan saw and reported it to his father)] the nakedness of his father [(Some say that he castrated him; others, that he sodomized him)], and he told his two brothers outside.
9:23	And Shem took [(Shem, exerting himself on behalf of the mitzvah more than Yefeth did (for which reason his descendants merited the mitzvah of tzitzith)] and Yefeth, the garment [(for which reason he merited burial for his descendants (Ezekiel 39:11), (the descendants of Cham, who shamed his father, being led in nakedness into exile (Isaiah 20:4)], and they placed it on the shoulders of both and they walked backwards, and they covered the nakedness of their father, and their faces were [(kept)] turned backwards [when they drew near him to cover him], and the nakedness of their father they did not see.
9:24	And Noach awoke from his wine and he knew what his "small" [i.e., unworthy, despicable] son had done to him.
9:25	And he said: Cursed is Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be to his brothers.
9:26	And he said: Blessed is the L rd, the G d of Shem, [who is destined to keep His promise to his (Shem's) seed and give them the land of Canaan], and Canaan will be a servant to him.
9:27	G d will "expand" Yefeth, but He will dwell in the tents of Shem, and Canaan will be a servant unto him. [Even after the sons of Shem are exiled, servants will be sold to them from the sons of Canaan.]
9:28	And Noach lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
9:29	And all the days of Noach were nine hundred and fifty years, and he died.
10
10:1	And these are the progeny of the sons of Noach — Shem, Cham, and Yafeth. And sons were born to them after the deluge.
10:2	The sons of Yefeth: Gomer, Magog, Maddai, Yavan, Tuval, Meshech and Tiras [Persia].
10:3	And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Rifath, and Togarmah.
10:4	And the sons of Yavan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
10:5	From these there branched out the islands of the nations in their lands, each after his tongue, according to their families in their nations.
10:6	And the sons of Cham: Kush, Mitzrayim, Fut, and Canaan.
10:7	And the sons of Kush: Seva, Chavilah, Savtah, Ra'amah, and Savtecha. And the sons of Ra'amah: Sheva and Dedan.
10:8	And Kush begot Nimrod. He began to be a mighty one in the earth [to cause all to rebel (nimrod = "Let us rebel") against the Holy One Blessed be He in the counsel of the Tower of Babel)].
10:9	He was a "mighty snare" [ensnaring men with his mouth and inciting them to rebel against G d] before the L rd ["to His face!"], wherefore it is said [of such as he]: "As Nimrod, a mighty snare before the L rd."
10:10	And the beginning of his kingdom was Bavel and Erech and Akkad and Kalnah in the land of Shinar.
10:11	Ashur went out of that land [when he saw his sons heeding Nimrod and building the tower in rebellion against the L rd], and he built Ninveh, and Rechovoth-Ir, and Kalach.
10:12	And Ressen, between Ninveh and Kalach. It [Ninveh] is "the great city." [see Jonah (1:2)]
10:13	And Mitzrayim begot Ludim and Anamim and Lehavim [so called because of their fiery faces (lahav = flame)] and Naftuchim.
10:14	And Patrusim and Kashluchim, whence came forth Plishtim and Kaftorim [Patrusim and Kasluchim "exchanging" their wives, and "between both" begetting Plishtim and Kaftorim].
10:15	And Canaan begot Tziddon, his first-born, and Cheth.
10:16	And the Yevussi and the Emori and the Girgashi.
10:17	And the Chivi and the Arki and the Sini.
10:18	And the Arvadi and the Tzemari and the Chamathi. And after, [from these] there spread forth [many] families of the Canaani.
10:19	And the border of the Canaani was from Tziddon as you come to Gerar, until Azzah; as you come to Sodom and Amorrah and Admah and Tzvoyim, until Lasha.
10:20	These are the sons of Cham according to their families. [(They are all sons of Cham, even though they branched out)] according to their tongues, in their lands, and in their nations.
10:21	And to Shem was born, he too, the father of all the children of Ever, [(i.e., Shem was the father of all the children of ever hanahar (the other side of the Euphrates)], the brother of Yefeth, the elder [(Cham not being mentioned in that he, unlike Shem and Yefeth, did not honor his father)].
10:22	The sons of Shem: Eilam, Ashur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.
10:23	And the sons of Aram: Utz, Chul, Gether, and Mash.
10:24	And Arpachshad begot Shalach, and Shelach begot Ever.
10:25	And to Ever was born two sons; the name of the first, Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided (niflegah) [Languages were confounded and men "divided themselves" throughout the earth], and the name of his brother was Yaktan. [(Because he "humbled" (hiktin) himself, he merited the many families (which follow).]
10:26	And Yaktan begot Almodad, and Shalef, and Chatzarmaveth, and Yarach.
10:27	And Hadoram, and Uzzal, and Diklah.
10:28	And Oval, and Avimael, and Sheva.
10:29	And Ofir, and Chavilah, and Yovav —- all these are the sons of Yaktan.
10:30	And their habitation was from Mesha, as you come to Sefar, a mountain of the east.
10:31	These are the sons of Shem by their families according to their tongues, in their lands according to their nations.
10:32	These are the families of the sons of Noach, their progeny according to their nations. And from these there branched out the nations of the earth after the deluge.
11
11:1	And all the earth was one language [the holy tongue] and single speech [i.e., united counsel].
11:2	And it was, when they traveled from the east [(see 10:30) to find a place that would contain them all] that they found a valley in the land of Shinar and they settled there.
11:3	And one [nation] said to the other: Ready yourselves. Let us make bricks, [there being no stone in Bavel (which is a valley)], and let us fire them [in an oven]. And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar [for wall plaster].
11:4	And they said: Let us build for ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves lest we be scattered [by an act of Heaven] upon the face of all the earth.
11:5	And the L rd "went down to see" [(an object lesson to judges: that they not judge until they see and understand)] the city and the tower which the sons of [ungrateful] man [whom He had rescued from the flood] had built.
11:6	And the L rd said: Behold, [all of this good is theirs:] they are one people, and all of them have one language, and this is what they begin to do! And now, should there not be withheld from them all that they scheme to do!
11:7	Let us [G d and the celestial tribunal (G d, in His great humility, including them with Him)] ("Let us") go down ["measure for measure" for "Let us build" (4)] and confound there their language, that one man not understand another's tongue [and discord result].
11:8	And the L rd scattered them from there [in this world ("measure for measure" for (4) "lest we be scattered")] on the face of all the earth, and they ceased building the city.
11:9	Therefore, it is called Bavel; for there the L rd confounded (balal) the language of all the earth, and from there the L rd scattered them [(their having no portion in the world to come)] on the face of all the earth.
11:10	These are the progeny of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old when he begot Arpachshad two years after the deluge.
11:11	And Shem lived after he begot Arpachshad, five hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.
11:12	And Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and he begot Shalach.
11:13	And Arpachshad lived after he begot Shelach four hundred and three years, and he begot sons and daughters.
11:14	And Shelach lived thirty years and he begot Ever.
11:15	And Shelach lived after he begot Ever four hundred and three years, and he begot sons and daughters.
11:16	And Ever lived thirty-four years and he begot Paleg.
11:17	And Ever lived after he begot Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and he begot sons and daughters.
11:18	And Peleg lived thirty years and he begot Re'u.
11:19	And Peleg lived after he begot Re'u, two hundred and nine years, and he begot sons and daughters.
11:20	And Re'u lived thirty-two years and he begot Serug.
11:21	And Re'u lived after he begot Serug two hundred and seven years, and he begot sons and daughters.
11:22	And Serug lived thirty years and he begot Nachor.
11:23	And Serug lived after he begot Nachor two hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.
11:24	And Nachor lived twenty-nine years and he begot Terach.
11:25	And Nachor lived after he begot Terach a hundred and nineteen years, and he begot sons and daughters.
11:26	And Terach lived seventy years and he begot Avram, Nachor, and Haran.
11:27	And these are the progeny of Terach: Terach begot Avram, Nachor and Haran, and Haran begot Lot.
11:28	And Haran died in the lifetime of Terach his father, in the land of his birth, Ur Kasdim.
11:29	And Avram and Nachor took for themselves wives. The name of the wife of Avram was Sarai, and the name of the wife of Nachor was Milkah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milkah and the father of Yiskah [Sarah, so called: because she "looked" (sachah) through the Holy Spirit, because all "gazed" at her beauty, and because of her queenly grace (nesichuth)]
11:30	And Sarah was barren; she had no child.
11:31	And Terach took Avram, his son, and Lot, the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai, his daughter-in-law, the wife of Avram, his son, and they [Terach and Avram] went out with them [Lot and Sarai] from Ur Kasdim to go to the land of Canaan; and they came until Charan and they dwelt there.
11:32	And the days of Terach were two hundred and five years, and Terach "died" in Charan, [the wicked, even in their lifetimes being called "dead" (Scripture stating this here so that Avram's leaving Charan not be felt as a breach of the honor due his father)].

12:1	And the L rd said to Avram: Go, for your sake, [for your benefit and for your good], from your land and from your birthplace, and from your father's house, to the land that I will show you.
12:2	And I shall make of you a great nation, and I shall bless you [with wealth], and I shall make your name great, and you shall be a [source of] blessing.
12:3	And I shall bless those who bless you, and those who curse you shall I curse, and they shall bless themselves in you [i.e., in your name] all the families of the earth.
12:4	And Avram went as the L rd spoke to him, and Lot went with him. And Avram was seventy-five years old when he went out of Charan.
12:5	And Avram took Sarai, his wife, and Lot, his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls [i.e., bondsmen and bondswomen] that they had acquired in Charan, and they went out to go to the land of Canaan, and they came to the land of Canaan.
12:6	And Avram passed through the land until the place of Shechem, until Eilon Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land, [conquering Eretz Yisrael from the seed of Shem].
12:7	And the L rd appeared to Avram and He said: To your seed shall I give this land. And he built there [for the tidings of the seed and of the land] an altar to the L rd, who had appeared to him.
12:8	And he removed from there [his tent] to the mountain east of Bethel. And he pitched his tent, [first Sarai's, then his], Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. And he built there an altar to the L rd, [perceiving prophetically that his children would go astray there by the sin of Achan (Joshua 7)], and he called, [interceding for them] in the name of the L rd.
12:9	And Avram journeyed progressively southwards, [towards Jerusalem].
12:10	And there was a famine in the land [of Canaan, whither G d had bidden him go — the L rd testing Avram], and Avram went down to Egypt to dwell there, for the famine was sore in the land.
12:11	And it was, as he approached Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife: Behold, now [the time has come to worry about your beauty.] I have long known you to be a beautiful woman.
12:12	And it will be, when the Egyptians see you, that they will say: "This is his wife!" and they will kill me and keep you alive.
12:13	Say, now, that you are my sister, so that it be well for me for your sake [i.e., so that they give me gifts], and so that I remain alive because of you.
12:14	And it was, when Avram came to Egypt, [with Sarai hidden in a chest] that the Egyptians spied the woman and found her to be very beautiful.
12:15	And the officers of Pharaoh saw her, and they praised her [among themselves] as being for Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
12:16	And he [Pharaoh] benefitted Avram for her sake, and he had flocks and herds, and he-asses, and bondsmen and bondswomen, and she-asses and camels.
12:17	And the L rd plagued Pharaoh with great afflictions, as well as [the people of] his house, at the behest of Sarai, Avram's wife.
12:18	And Pharaoh called to Avram and he said: What is this that you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she is your wife?
12:19	Why did you say "She is my sister," so that I took her for me as a wife? And now, here is your wife. Take her and go [out of Egypt (for the Egyptians are licentious)].
12:20	And Pharaoh appointed men for him [to guard him], and they escorted him and his wife and all that was his.
13
13:1	And Avram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that was with him, and Lot with him to the south [of Eretz Yisrael].
13:2	And Avram was very heavy, with kine, with silver and with gold.
13:3	And he went on his travels, [from Egypt, stopping in the same inns as when he had journeyed there (whence we derive that one should not vary his lodgings)] from the south [Egypt being south of Canaan] until Bethel, until the place where his tent was in the beginning, between Bethel and Ai.
13:4	To the place of the altar which he had made there at first, where Avram had called upon the name of the L rd.
13:5	And also unto Lot, who went with Avram [— because he went with Avram] there were flocks and herds, and tents.
13:6	And the [pasturage of the] land did not suffice for them to dwell together, for their substance was great, and they could not dwell together.
13:7	And there was a dispute between Avram's herdsmen and Lot's herdsmen [the former rebuking the latter for allowing their flocks to grace in others' fields, the latter arguing that there was no theft in this in that the land belonged to Lot, Avram's sole heir.] But [(states Scripture)] the Canaani and the Perizi then dwelt in the land, [so that Avram not yet having taken possession of the land, the practice of Lot's herdsmen did, indeed, constitute theft.]
13:8	And Avram said to Lot: Let there not be a dispute between me and you, and between my herdsmen and yours, for we are kinsmen.
13:9	Is not the whole land before you? Part, I pray you, from me. If you go to the left, I will be at your right [to defend you]; and if you go to the right, I will be at your left.
13:10	And Lot lifted his eyes and saw the whole plain of the Jordan, it being all watered [with streams]. Before the L rd destroyed Sodom and Amorah, it was like the Garden of the L rd, like the land of Egypt [for sowing] until Tzoar.
13:11	And Lot chose for himself the entire plain of the Jordan, and Lot traveled from the east [of Avram, going west], and they parted, one from the other.
13:12	Avram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain, and he pitched tents [for his herdsmen and his herds] until Sodom.
13:13	And the people of Sodom were evil [with their bodies] and sinful [with their wealth] to the L rd exceedingly, [in spite of which Lot did not forbear living among them].
13:14	And the L rd said to Avram after Lot departed from him [(the Word not coming to him so long as that evil one was with him)]: Raise your eyes, now, and see, from the place where you are — north, south, east, and west.
13:15	For all the land that you see, to you shall I give it, and to your seed forever.
13:16	And I shall make your seed as the dust of the earth — so that just as the dust of the earth cannot be counted, so your seed will not be counted.
13:17	Arise, walk in the land, in its length and its breadth, for to you shall I give it.
13:18	And Avram pitched his tent, and he came and he dwelt in the plains of [the man] Mamre, in Chevron, and he built there an altar to the L rd.
14
14:1	And it was in the days of Amrafel [Nimrod (10:8-9)], king of Shinar; Aryoch, king of Elassar; Kedarlaomer, king of Elam; and Tidal, king of Goyim, [a place so called because many nations (goyim) gathered there],
14:2	that they made war with Bera ["evil" (to Heaven and evil to man)], king of Sodom; Birsha [(ascending "in wickedness")], king of Amorah; Shinav ["hating his Father" (in heaven)], king of Admah; Shemever ["took wing" (to rebel against the L rd)], king of Tzvoyim, and the king of Bela, which is [the city of] Tzoar.
14:3	All of these joined together in the valley of Siddim ["many fields"], which is [now] the Salt Sea, [the waters having spilled into it].
14:4	Twelve years they [these five kings] served Kedarlaomer, and for thirteen years, they rebelled.
14:5	And in the fourteenth year [of their rebellion], Kedarlaomer came and the kings who were with him, [the other three], and they smote Refaim in Ashteroth Karnayim, the Zuzim [same as Zamzumim (Deuteronomy 2:10)] in Ham, and the Eimim in Shaveh Kiryathaim.
14:6	And the Chori, in their mountain, Seir, until El [the plain of] Paran, which is near the desert.
14:7	And they returned and they came to Ein Mishpat ["the spring of judgment" (so called because Moses and Aaron were destined to be judged there regarding the spring (Numbers 20:1 and 14)], which is Kadesh, and they smote the entire field of the Amaleki [so called in terms of the future, (Amalek not having yet been born)], and also the Emori, who dwelt in Chatzatzon Tamar [Ein Gedi].
14:8	And there went out the king of Sodom and the king of Amorah and the king of Admah and the king of Tzvoyim and the king of Bela, which is Tzoar, and they waged war against them in the valley of Siddim.
14:9	Kedarlaomer, king of Elam; Tidal, king of Goyim; Amrafel, king of Shinar; Aryoch, king of Elassar — four kings against the five, [in spite of which the former were victorious (a tribute to Avram's subsequent vanquishing of them)].
14:10	And the valley of Siddim was full of bitumen pits, and the king of Sodom and Amorah fled and fell there, and those that remained fled to a mountain.
14:11	And they took all the wealth of Sodom and Amorah and all of their food and they went.
14:12	And they took Lot and his wealth, the son of Avram's brother, and they went. And he sat in Sodom. [What was the cause of his being despoiled? His sitting in Sodom.]
14:13	And the survivor came, [Og, who had escaped from the battle (see Deuteronomy 3:11)], and he told Avram the Ivri, [from ever (the other side of) the river (Euphrates)]; and he lived in the plains of Mamre, the Emori, the brother of Eshkol and the brother of Aner, who had made a covenant with Avram.
14:14	And Avram heard that his brother had been taken captive, and he spurred his novices, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and he pursued them until Dan, [his strength waning there (Avram seeing, prophetically, that his descendants were destined to erect the image of a calf there)].
14:15	And he and his servants divided [themselves] against them at night, and he pursued them until Chovah, [Dan, so called because of its guilt (chov), idolatry], which was to the left of Damascus.
14:16	And he returned all of the wealth, and also Lot, his brother, and his wealth he returned, and also the women and the people.
14:17	And the king of Sodom went out towards him after he returned from smiting Kedarlaomer and the kings who were with him, to the valley of Shaveh, the king's vale [his race-course].
14:18	And Malkitzedek, the king of Shalem, brought out bread and wine [(standing fare for the battle-weary), Malkitzedek demonstrating thereby that he bore Avram no malice for having killed his sons.] And he was a Cohein to G d on High.
14:19	And he blessed him and said: Blessed is Avram to G d on High, Possessor of heaven and earth, [having acquired them by creating them].
14:20	And blessed is G d on High, who has delivered your foes into your hand. And he (Avram) gave him a tithe of all, [Malkitzedek being a Cohein].
14:21	And the king of Sodom said to Avram: Give me the souls [from the spoils taken of me, which you have rescued], and the wealth take for yourself.
14:22	And Avram said to the king of Sodom: I lift my hand [in oath] to the L rd, G d on High, Possessor of heaven and earth,
14:23	Nothing — from a thread until a sandal latchet [shall I keep for myself], nor shall I take [from your treasure house, if you would offer it to me,] anything that is yours, so that you not say: "I made Avram rich" [for the L rd promised to make me rich (12:2)]
14:24	Except what the youths have eaten, and the portion of the men [my bondsmen], who went with me [to do battle, and] Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre, [who guarded the baggage] — they shall take their portion.
15
15:1	After these things, [the miracles wrought for him in vanquishing the kings, (Avram worrying that he might thereby have received his full reward)], the word of the L rd came to Avram in a vision, saying: Do not fear, Avram; I am a shield [against punishment] for you [for the men that you have killed; and, as to your concern over having received your full reward], your reward is extremely great.
15:2	And Avram said: L rd G d, what will You give me? I go wasted, [without children], and the purveyor of my household, [who would otherwise, be my son,] is Eliezer of Damascus.
15:3	And Avram said: Behold, to me You have not given seed. [Of what avail, then, is all You have given me], when the son of my household [Eliezer] shall inherit me?
15:4	And, behold, the word of the L rd (came) to him, saying: This one shall not inherit you, but one who issues from your loins — he will inherit you.
15:5	And He took him outside [of his tent], and He said: Look, now, heavenwards, and count the stars if you can count them. And He said to him: Thus shall be your seed.
15:6	And he believed in the L rd, [not asking a sign for this as he did for the inheritance of the land (8)], and He accounted it [his not asking for a sign] unto him as righteousness.
15:7	And He said to him: I am the L rd who took you out of Ur Kasdim to give you this land to inherit it.
15:8	And he said: O L rd, G d, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?
15:9	And He said to him: Take for Me three heifers, [intimating three bullocks: the bullock of Yom Kippur, the bullock of communal forgetfulness (Leviticus 4:13), and the bullock of the broken neck (Deuteronomy 21:4)], and three goats, [intimating the goat offered within (the holy of holies), the additional Festival goats, and the sin-offering goat of the individual (as opposed to that of the congregation)], and three rams, [intimating the confirmed guilt-offering, the suspended guilt-offering, and the sin-offering ewe of the individual], and a turtle-dove and a young pigeon.
15:10	And he took unto Him all these, [(the bullocks, rams, and goats, representing the nations; and the young doves, Israel)] and he split them [it being the custom of those entering into a covenant to split a beast and walk through the pieces, (G d and Avram entering into a covenant here for Israel's inheritance of the land)], (… and he split them) in the middle, [(a sign that the nations would be destroyed)]. And he placed each piece opposite the other; but the birds he did not split [(a sign that Israel would remain "intact")].
15:11	And (predatory) birds swooped down upon the [pieces of the] carcasses, and Avram swept them away [(a sign that David the son of Yishai will seek to destroy them (the nations), but will not be permitted to do so, until the advent of the Messiah.)]
15:12	And the sun was about to set when a great sleep fell over Avram, and behold, a great dark fright [(intimating the woes and darkness of Israel's exiles)] descended upon him.
15:13	And He said to Avram: Know shall you know that your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and they shall serve them and they shall afflict them, four hundred years [(from the birth of Isaac until the exodus)].
15:14	And also [(including the four kingdoms)] the nation that they shall serve will I judge [with ten plagues], and afterwards they shall leave with great wealth [see Exodus 12:36].
15:15	And you will come to your fathers [(Terach repented of his idolatry)] in peace [not witnessing any of the above]. You will be buried in a good old age, [Ishmael repenting and Esav not turning to evil in his days].
15:16	And the fourth generation [of the Egyptian exile] shall return here [to Canaan (e.g., Calev, the son of Chetzron, the son of Peretz, the son of Judah was among those entering the land)], for the sin of the Emori would not have been consummated, [(justifying their being driven out of the land)] until then.
15:17	And it was, when the sun had set and it was dark, and, behold, a smoking furnace and a torch of fire that passed between these pieces [(intimating the descent of the kingdoms into Gehinnom)].
15:18	On that day the L rd made a covenant with Avram, saying: To your seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt until the Great River, the Euphrates [(called the "Great river" because of its being mentioned in conjunction with Eretz Yisrael)].
15:19	The Keini and the Kenizi and the Kadmoni.
15:20	And the Chitti and the Perizi and the Refaim.
15:21	And the Emori and the Canaani and the Girgashi and the Yevussi, [ten nations all told, although only seven were conquered. The Keini, the Kenizi, and the Kadmoni (Edom, Moav, and Ammon) were destined to be inherited in time to come (Isaiah 11:4)].
16
16:1	And Sarai the wife of Avram had not borne (children) unto him. And she had an Egyptian handmaid [the daughter of Pharaoh], whose name was Hagar.
16:2	And Sarai said to Avram: Behold, the L rd has held me back from bearing. Come, I pray you, to my handmaid. Perhaps I will be built up through her [in the merit of bringing my rival into my house]. And Avram heeded the voice [the Holy spirit] of Sarai.
16:3	And Sarai the wife of Avram "took" [by suasion] Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after ten years [(this being the mandatory period for taking a new wife after a childless union)] of Avram's dwelling in the land of Canaan [(the years outside the land of Canaan being irrelevant in this regard)], and she gave her to Avram her husband as a wife.
16:4	And he came to Hagar and she conceived [from the first union]. And when she saw that she had [thus] conceived, her mistress became light in her eyes [by invidious comparison].
16:5	And Sarai said to Avram: [The punishment for] my being wronged is upon you [for having prayed that you (not necessarily I) be granted children]. I gave my handmaid into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived I became light in her eyes. May the L rd judge between me and you.
16:6	And Avram said to Sarai: Behold, your handmaid is in your hand. Do with her as is good in your eyes. And Sarai afflicted her [with arduous labor] and she fled from her presence.
16:7	And an angel of the L rd found her by a well of water in the desert, by the well on the way to Shur.
16:8	And he said: Hagar, handmaid of Sarai, whence do you come and whither are you going? And she said: I am fleeing Sarai my mistress.
16:9	And an angel of the L rd said to her [(a different angel being sent for each "saying")]: Return to your mistress and be afflicted under her hands.
16:10	And an angel of the L rd said to her: I shall multiply your seed, and they shall not be counted for multitude.
16:11	And an angel of the L rd said to her: Behold, you shall conceive [(her first conception having been aborted by Sarai's "evil eye")], and you will bear a son; and call his name Ishmael, for G d [El] has given heed [shama] to your afflictions.
16:12	And he will be a man of the wilderness, his hand against all [i.e., a robber] and the hand of all against him, [hating him and assailing him], and on the face of his brothers shall he dwell, [his seed being numerous].
16:13	And she called the name of the L rd who spoke to her "You are the G d of seeing"; for she said: Would I have believed to see [an angel of the L rd] here [in the wilderness], too, after having seen (angels) [in the house of Avram]?
16:14	She, therefore, called the well "the well of the appearance of the living (angel)." It is between Kadesh and Bared.
16:15	And Hagar bore a son to Avram. And Avram called [through the Holy Spirit] the name of his son, whom Hagar had borne, "Ishmael."
16:16	And Avram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Avram [(this being mentioned to Ishmael's credit, that though thirteen years old when circumcised, (17:24-25), he did not protest)].
17
17:1	And Avram was ninety-nine years old, and the L rd appeared to Avram and He said to him: I am the All-Sufficient G d. [Therefore,] walk before Me [i.e., worship Me] and be whole [in the trials I shall set for you, and I shall be your Patron].
17:2	And I shall set My covenant [of love and of inheritance of the land (through the mitzvah of circumcision)] between Me and you, and I will increase you exceedingly.
17:3	And Avram fell upon his face [in awe, lacking the power to stand in the presence of the Shechinah while yet uncircumcised]. And the L rd spoke to him, saying:
17:4	I, behold, My covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations.
17:5	And your name will no longer be called Avram, but your name will be Avraham, for a father of a multitude (av hamon) of nations have I made you [("Av (ra) ham," acronymically = av hamon)]
17:6	And I shall multiply you exceedingly, and I shall make of you nations [Israel and Edom, (Ishmael already having been born)], and kings will go forth from you.
17:7	And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations as an eternal covenant, [My covenant being] to be a G d unto you and unto your seed after you.
17:8	And I will give unto you and unto your seed after you the land of your sojournings, the whole land of Canaan, as an eternal holding, and [there] I will be a G d unto them [(but if one lives elsewhere, it is "as if he has no G d")].
17:9	And G d said to Abraham: And, [as for] you, My covenant shall you keep, you and your seed after you throughout your generations.
17:10	[And what constitutes its "keeping"?] This is My covenant which you shall keep between Me and you [those living now] and your seed after you, [those yet to be born] — that all of your males be circumcised.
17:11	And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be for a sign of the covenant between Me and you.
17:12	And at eight days old, every male of yours throughout your generations shall be circumcised, (whether) born at home [of your maidservant] or bought for money [after he was born] of any stranger who is not of your seed.
17:13	Circumcised, he shall be circumcised, [in any event, even (in certain cases) after eight days], one born in your house and one bought for your money, and My covenant shall be in your flesh as an everlasting covenant.
17:14	And an uncircumcised male [(the locus of circumcision being the "maleness" locus)], who does not circumcise the flesh of his foreskin [upon reaching the age of liability] — that soul shall be cut off from its people, [going childless and dying before his time. (But if his father is remiss in circumcising him, he is in transgression of a positive commandment, but does not incur "cutting off")]; My covenant has he broken.
17:15	And G d said to Abraham: Sarai your wife — you shall not call her name Sarai ["my mistress"]; but her name is Sarah ["mistress (over all)"].
17:16	And I shall bless her, [rejuvenating her (18:12)], and I shall also give from her to you a son, and I shall bless her [with nursing breasts], and nations will issue from her; kings of peoples will come from her.
17:17	And Abraham fell upon his face and he rejoiced. And he said in his heart: Would [anyone think that] a man of a hundred [would] beget! or that Sarah, a woman of ninety, would bear!
17:18	And Abraham said to G d: Would that Ishmael lived before You [i.e., worshipping You]!
17:19	And G d said: In truth, Sarah your wife shall bear a son unto you, and you shall call his name Yitzchak ["He shall laugh"], and I shall establish My covenant [of circumcision] with him, [and not with the sons of Ishmael and Keturah], an everlasting covenant, for his seed after him
17:20	And, as for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him and have made him fruitful, and have multiplied him exceedingly. Twelve princes (nesi'im) [also construable as "clouds" (which will vanish)] will he beget, and I shall make him a great nation.
17:21	And My covenant shall I establish with Isaac [(Isaac was "holy", i.e., circumcised, from birth)], whom Sarah will bear unto you at this time in the following year.
17:22	And He finished speaking with him, and G d went up from Abraham, [(the righteous being the "chariot" of the L rd)].
17:23	And Abraham took Ishmael his son and all that were born in his house and all that were bought with his money, every male of the men of Abraham's household, and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin. On this very same day, [in the daytime and not at night, (not fearing heathens or mockers, and (also) so that his foes and his contemporaries not say: Had we seen him, we would not have permitted him to do G d's bidding)], as G d had spoken to him.
17:24	And Abraham was ninety-nine years old when the flesh of his foreskin was circumcised.
17:25	And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when the flesh of his foreskin was circumcised.
17:26	On this very same day, [when Abraham had completed his ninety-ninth year, and Ishmael, his thirteenth,] Abraham and Ishmael his son were circumcised.
17:27	And all the men of his house, born in the house or bought with money from a stranger, were circumcised with him.
Vayeira
18
18:1	And the L rd appeared to him [to "visit the sick," it being the third day after his circumcision,] in the terebinths of Mamre, [Mamre having counseled him concerning circumcision]. And he sat at the opening of the tent [to host passersby] in the heat of the day.
18:2	And he lifted his eyes and he saw, and, behold, three men [i.e., angels] were standing over him, [one to give tidings to Sarah (that she would bear a son), one to overturn Sodom, and one to heal Abraham.] And he saw [that they were hesitating to approach him], and he ran towards them from the opening of the tent, and he bowed down to the ground.
18:3	And he said [to the greatest of them]: My lord, if I have now found favor in your eyes, do not now pass away from your servant.
18:4	Let there be taken now a little water and wash your feet [(Abraham taking them for Arabs, who bow down idolatrously "to the dust of their feet")], and recline under the tree.
18:5	And I shall take a piece of bread, and feast your hearts, and then pass on. For you have therefore passed by (the domicile of) your servant. And they said: So do, as you have spoken.
18:6	And Abraham hurried to the tent, to Sarah, and he said: Bring quickly three measures of meal [to cover the pot], fine flour [for cakes], and knead it, and make cakes.
18:7	And Abraham ran to the herd, and he took a calf, tender and good, and he gave it to the youth [Ishmael], and he hurried to dress it.
18:8	And he cook cream and milk and the calf which he had dressed, and he set it before them, and he stood over them under the tree and they [gave the impression that they] ate.
18:9	And they said to him: Where is Sarah, your wife? And he said: Behold, she is in the tent. [(She is modest.)]
18:10	And he said: I [the L rd] shall surely return to you at this time [Pesach] next year, and, behold, a son to Sarah your wife. And Sarah was listening at the opening of the tent, and it [the opening] was behind him [the angel].
18:11	And Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years. There had ceased in Sarah the way of women [i.e., menstruation].
18:12	And Sarah laughed in [i.e., concerning] her innards, saying: After withering, I have been rejuvenated, and my lord is old.
18:13	And the L rd said to Abraham: Why, now, did Sarah laugh, saying: "Will I in truth give birth when I am old?" [(Scripture alters her words her for "the sake of peace." She really said: "when my lord is old.")]
18:14	Is anything beyond the L rd? At the appointed time I will return to you, at this time next year, and Sarah will have a son.
18:15	And Sarah denied, saying: "I did not laugh," for she was afraid. And He said: "No, but you did laugh!"
18:16	And the men arose from there, and they lowered at the face of Sodom. And Abraham went with them to escort them.
18:17	And the L rd said: Shall I conceal from Abraham what I am going to do [to Sodom]?
18:18	— when Abraham is destined to be a great and mighty nation in whom all the nations of the world will be blessed?
18:19	For I have known him because he commands his children and his household after him to keep the way of the L rd to do righteousness and judgment so that the L rd bring upon Abraham what He spoke concerning him.
18:20	And the L rd said: The outcry of Sodom and Amorah, because it has become great, and their sin, because it is very heavy —
18:21	I shall go down now and I shall see: If according to its outcry which comes unto Me, they have done [and persist in doing, I shall bring] destruction [upon them]. And if [they do] not [persist in their evil], I shall know [how to exact retribution for what they have already done].
18:22	And the men turned from there [whence Abraham had accompanied them], and they went to Sodom; and Abraham still stood before the L rd.
18:23	And Abraham drew near [to contend, to conciliate, and to pray], and he said: Will You also cause to perish the righteous one with the wicked one?
18:24	Perhaps there are fifty righteous ones in the midst of the city, [ten for each district, there being five (distinct) places] — Will You also cause to perish — and will You not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous ones in its midst?
18:25	It is profane in You to do such a thing, to kill a righteous one with a wicked one, rendering the righteous one like the wicked one. It is profane in You. Will the Judge of all the land not do justice?
18:26	And the L rd said: If I find in Sodom fifty righteous ones in the midst of the city, then I shall spare the entire place [i.e., all (five) districts] for their sake.
18:27	And Abraham answered and he said: I have now willed to speak to the L rd when I should [already] have been [reduced to] dust [by the kings] and ashes [by Nimrod].
18:28	Perhaps there shall lack of the fifty righteous ones, five. Will You destroy the entire city because of the five [and not add Yourself as a "righteous One" to each district to save the whole]? And He said: I shall not destroy if I find there forty-five.
18:29	And he ventured to speak more unto Him and he said: Perhaps there will be found there forty [in four districts. Will You not save those districts?] And He said: I shall not do [i.e., destroy] for the sake of the forty.
18:30	And he said: Let not the L rd be wroth and I will speak. Perhaps there will be found there thirty. And He said: I shall not do if I find there thirty.
18:31	And he said: Behold, I have willed to speak to the L rd. Perhaps there will be found there twenty. And He said: I will not destroy for the sake of the twenty.
18:32	And he said: Let not the L rd be wroth and I will speak but this [last] time. Perhaps there will be found there ten. And He said: I will not destroy for the sake of the ten. [He did not venture to plead for less, reasoning from the fact that Noach, his sons, and their wives (eight altogether), had failed to save their generation (and having sought for but not having found nine in combination with the L rd)].
18:33	And the L rd went when He finished speaking with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.
19
19:1	And the two angels, [one to destroy Sodom; the other, to save Lot,] came to Sodom in the evening. And Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom [having that day been appointed as a judge.] And Lot saw and he arose towards them, and he bowed down with his face to the ground.
19:2	And he said: Behold, now, my lords: Turn, now, [by a side-path so that you not be noticed] to the house of your servant, and sleep over and wash your feet, [afterwards, so that the men of Sodom think you to be recently arrived, and not fault me for having hidden you from them], and rise early and go on your way. And they said: No, but we will sleep over in the street.
19:3	And he greatly implored them, and they turned aside to him and they came to his house. And he made a feast for them, and he baked matzoth, [it being Pesach], and they ate.
19:4	They had not yet lain down, when the people of the city, the people of Sodom [i.e., evildoers], surrounded the house, from young to old — all of the people, from [one] end [of the city to the other (i.e., none protesting)].
19:5	And they called to Lot and they said to him: Where are the men who came to you this night? Bring them out to us that we may know [i.e., cohabit with] them.
19:6	And Lot went out to them at the door and he closed the door behind him.
19:7	And he said: Do not, I pray you, my brothers, do ill.
19:8	Behold, now, I have two daughters who have not known a man. Let me take them out now to you, and do to them as you wish. But to these men do not do anything; for therefore have they come under the shade of my roof.
19:9	And they said [in respect to his offering his daughters]: "Betake yourself." And they said [in respect to his shielding of the angels]: The one [Lot] came to sojourn and he would be a judge! Now we shall harm you more than them! And they pressed upon the man, Lot, and they drew near to break down the door.
19:10	And the men sent forth their hands and they brought Lot unto them into the house, and they shut the door.
19:11	And the men at the entrance of the house they smote with blindness, from small, [who had initiated the transgression (19:4)], to great, and they wearied themselves to find the entrance.
19:12	And the men said to Lot: Who else [besides your wife and your daughters at home] do you have here? [(If you have)] a son-in-law, or your sons [from your married daughters] and your daughters, and all that you have in the city — take it from the place.
19:13	For we are going to destroy this place. For their outcry has grown great before the L rd and the L rd has sent us to destroy it.
19:14	And Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law [(He had two married daughters in the city)] [and to] the takers of his daughters [i.e., the men to whom his two daughters at home were betrothed], and he said: Arise, go out of this place; for the L rd is going to destroy the city. And he was as a jester in the eyes of his sons-in-law.
19:15	And when the morning star rose [see 24], the angels rushed Lot, saying: Arise, take your wife and your two daughters who are found [at home], lest you perish in the sin of the city.
19:16	And he lingered [to save his wealth], and the men took hold of his hand, and the hand of his wife, and the hand of his two daughters, in the L rd's mercy upon him, and they took him out, and they placed him outside the city.
19:17	And it was, when they took them outside, that he [the angel deputed to save Lot] said: Escape with your life [and give no heed to your wealth]. Do not look behind you [at the destruction of Sodom, when you yourself are being saved.] And do not stand in the entire plain [of the Jordan]. Escape to the mountain [i.e., to Abraham, who dwells on the mountain (12:8)], lest you perish.
19:18	And Lot said to them: Do not [urge me to escape to the mountain], I pray You, O L rd —
19:19	Behold, now, Your servant has found favor in Your eyes, and You have magnified Your lovingkindness which You did with me to keep my soul alive. I cannot escape to the mountain lest evil be imputed to me [relative to the righteousness of Abraham], and I die.
19:20	Behold, now, this city is close by to flee there, and it is small, [with few people, so that it may be spared]. Let me escape there, I pray You — Is it not small? [so that it may be spared], and my soul will live.
19:21	And He said to him: I have granted you favor also for this thing [(that the entire city be saved for your sake)], not to overthrow the city of which you spoke.
19:22	Hurry, escape there. For I shall not be able to do anything until you come there. For this reason [i.e., that it is small (mitzar)], the city is called Tzoar.
19:23	The sun rose upon the earth and Lot came to Tzoar.
19:24	And the L rd [He and His beth-din] had rained down upon Sodom and Amorah [when the morning star had risen (15), (when both sun and moon were in the heavens, so that no opening be given to sun or moon worshippers to attribute the destruction to the absence of their deity) rain which changed to] brimstone and fire, from the L rd, from the heavens [the source of judgment].
19:25	And He overturned these cities [(the four were situated on one rock, which He overturned] and the entire plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and the growth of the ground.
19:26	And his wife looked from [i.e., when she was] behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
19:27	And Abraham arose early in the morning (to go) to the place where he had stood before the L rd.
19:28	And he looked out upon Sodom and Amorah and upon all the land of the plain, and he saw, and, behold, the smoke-column of the land rose as the smoke-column of a limekiln.
19:29	And it was, when G d destroyed the cities of the plain, that G d remembered Abraham, and He sent Lot from the midst of the overturning, when He overturned the cities where Lot dwelt.
19:30	And Lot went up from Tzoar and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him, for he was afraid to dwell in Tzoar, [it being too close to Sodom], and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
19:31	And the elder said to the younger: Our father is old [and "if not now, when?"], and there is no man to cohabit with us in the way of all the land. [They assumed that all had perished as in the time of the flood.]
19:32	Let us go and make our father drink wine and let us live with him and let us bring our father's seed to life.
19:33	And they made their father drink wine that night [(Wine was "readied" for them in the cave for the bringing forth of two nations)]. And the elder came and lay with her father, and he did not know in her lying and in her rising.
19:34	And it was on the morrow, that the elder said to the younger: I lay yesterday with my father. Let us give him wine to drink this night, too; and come, lie with him, and we will bring our father's seed to life.
19:35	And they gave their father wine to drink on that night, too. And the younger arose and lay with him. And he did not know, in her lying down or in her getting up.
19:36	And the two daughters of Lot conceived from their father.
19:37	And the elder bore a son, and she called him Moav (lit., "from the father"). He is the father of Moav until this day.
19:38	And the younger — she, too, bore a son, and she called him Ben-Ami (lit., "son of my people"). He is the father of the sons of Ammon until this day.
20
20:1	And Abraham traveled from there to the land of the south, [seeing that wayfarers had ceased with the destruction of the cities]. And he dwelt between Kadesh and Shur, and he lived in Gerar.
20:2	And Abraham said of Sarah his wife: "She is my sister." And Avimelech, the king of Gerar, sent and took Sarah.
20:3	And G d came to Avimelech in a dream by night, and He said: Behold, you shall die because of the woman you have taken, for she is another man's wife.
20:4	And Avimelech did not come near to her, [an angel preventing him], and he said: Do You then slay even a righteous nation [(i.e., the generation of the flood and of Bavel) as You now threaten to slay me?]
20:5	Did he not say to me: "She is my sister"? And she, also she, [(including her bondsmen, camel drivers, and ass drivers)] said to me: "He is my brother." With innocence of heart, [not thinking to sin], and with cleanness of hands, [not having touched her] did I do this.
20:6	And G d said to him in a dream: I, too, know that you did this with innocence of heart, [not thinking to sin; but there is no "cleanness of hands" here,] for I, too, kept you from sinning to Me, wherefore I did not enable you to touch her.
20:7	And, now, return the man's wife, [and do not think he will not take her back, assuming that you have lived with her, or that he will hate you and not pray for you], for he is a prophet [and he knows that you have not touched her], and he will pray for you, and you will live. And if you do not return (her), know that you will surely die, you and all that is yours.
20:8	And Avimelech arose early in the morning and he called all of his servants and he spoke all of these words in their ears, and the men feared greatly.
20:9	And Avimelech called to Abraham and said to him: What did you do to us and how have I sinned to you that you have brought upon me and my kingdom a great sin? Things that are not done have you done with me, [i.e., You have brought upon us an unnatural plague, the stoppage of all natural passages].
20:10	And Avimelech said to Abraham: What did you see that you did this thing?
20:11	And Abraham said: For I said: There is surely no fear of G d in this place [When one comes to a city should they ask him whether he is in need of lodging or whether the woman with him is his wife or his sister!], and they will slay me because of my wife.
20:12	And also, in truth, she is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife. [(Sarah, the daughter of Abraham's brother Haran (11:29) is considered the daughter of his father, and a sister by one's father is permitted to a Noachide.)]
20:13	And it was, when G d caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, [realizing that we would pass through places of evildoers]: This is your lovingkindness that you shall do with me: Wherever we come, say about me: "He is my brother."
20:14	And Avimelech took flocks and herds and bondsmen and bondswomen and he gave them to Abraham [to conciliate him so that he would pray for him], and he returned to him Sarah his wife.
20:15	And Avimelech said: Here is my land before you; dwell wherever you like.
20:16	And to Sarah he said [in conciliation]: Behold, I have given a thousand pieces of silver to your brother. It is a "covering of the eyes" for you of all who are with you, [that they not look lightly upon you, assuming you to have been violated by me and then discarded, (the payment indicating that I was "forced" to give you up)], and (it is a covering of the eyes) of all [men] and proof [that you have not been violated].
20:17	And Abraham prayed to G d, and G d healed Avimelech and his wife and his bondswomen, and they were relieved [i.e., their passages were opened].
20:18	For the L rd had stopped up every passage in the house of Avimelech at the bidding of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
21
21:1	And the L rd had visited Sarah [even before healing Avimelech, (one who prays for his neighbor — as Abraham did for Avimelech — being answered first)], as He had said [regarding conception (17:19)], and the L rd did unto Sarah as He had spoken [to Abraham regarding the birth of an heir (15:1)].
21:2	And Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time of which G d had spoken [18:4].
21:3	And Abraham called the name of the son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore unto him, Isaac.
21:4	And Abraham circumcised Isaac his son when he was eight days old, as G d had commanded him.
21:5	And Abraham was a hundred years old when Isaac his son was born to him.
21:6	And Sarah said: G d made rejoicing for me. All who hear will rejoice for me.
21:7	And she said: Who is it [(i.e., see how exalted He is)] who said [(milel, 100 in gematria) that in the hundredth year] of Abraham Sarah would suckle children [(the matrons bringing their children to her to be nursed)], for I have borne a son in his old age.
21:8	And the child grew and he was weaned [after twenty-four months], and Abraham made a great feast [i.e., one attended by the great men of the generation] on the day that Isaac was weaned.
21:9	And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, disporting himself [with idolatry].
21:10	And she said to Abraham: Drive out this maidservant and her son. For the son of this maidservant will not inherit with my son [(even if he were not Isaac)], with Isaac [(even if he were not my son)].
21:11	And the thing was very bad in the eyes of Abraham because of [being asked to drive out] his son.
21:12	And G d said to Abraham: Let it not be bad in your eyes because of the youth and because of your maidservant. Whatever Sarah says to you, hearken to her [(whence we derive that Abraham was secondary to Sarah in prophecy)]; for in Isaac will there be called seed unto you.
21:13	And also the son of the maidservant I shall make a nation of him, for he is your seed.
21:14	And Abraham rose early in the morning and he took bread and a skin-vessel of water, [but not silver and gold, for he hated Ishmael for having become corrupt], and he gave it to Hagar, placing it on her shoulder, along with the child [(Sarah having cast an evil eye upon him, rendering him feverish and unable to walk)], and he sent her and she went; and she strayed [She returned to the idolatry of her father's house] in the desert of Beersheva.
21:15	And the water in the skin-vessel was finished and she cast the child under one of the growths.
21:16	And she went and she sat from afar, about two bow shots away. For she said: Let me not see the death of the child. And [when he was close to death], she sat down farther off, and she lifted up her voice and she cried.
21:17	And G d heard the voice of the youth [(whence it is derived that the sick one's plaint is sooner heard and answered than the prayer of others for him)], and an angel of G d called to Hagar from heaven, and he said to her: What grieves you, Hagar? Do not fear. For G d has heard the voice of the child in his present station. [For the ministering angels protested Ishmael's being saved from thirst when he was destined to cause Israel to die of thirst (see Isaiah 21:13-14), and G d answered that he was being judged according to his present (guiltless) status].
21:18	Arise, lift up the child and strengthen your hand in him, for I shall make him a great nation.
21:19	And G d opened her eyes and she beheld a well of water, and she went and filled up the skin-vessel with water, and she gave the youth to drink.
21:20	And G d was with the youth, and he grew up, and he dwelt in the desert and became a bowman.
21:21	And he dwelt in the desert of Paran, and his mother took for him a wife from the land of Egypt [where she had been reared.]
21:22	And it was at that time that Avimelech and Phichol, the captain of his host, [seeing that Abraham had escaped the destruction of the region of Sodom, that he had defeated the kings (section 14), and that his wife had borne a child to him in his old age] said to Abraham: G d is with you in all that you do.
21:23	And, now, swear to me here by G d that you will not deal falsely with me, or with my child, or with my grandchild, [(thus far, a man's compassion for his children)]. As the lovingkindness that I did with you [viz. (20:15): "Behold, my land is before you"] do with me and with the land in which you dwelt.
21:24	And Abraham said: I shall swear.
21:25	And Abraham contended with Avimelech over the well of water that the servants of Avimelech had stolen.
21:26	And Avimelech said: I do not know who did this thing, and you, too, did not tell me, and I, too, did not hear of it until today.
21:27	And Abraham took sheep and kine and gave them to Avimelech and the two of them made a covenant.
21:28	And Abraham stood the seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves.
21:29	And Avimelech said to Abraham: What are these seven ewe-lambs which you have stood by themselves?
21:30	And he said: For seven ewe-lambs shall you take from my hand, that this [the waters of the well miraculously rising to Abraham in "confirmation" of his ownership] be a testimony unto me that I have dug this well.
21:31	Therefore, he called that place Beersheva, for there they both swore (nishbe'u).
21:32	And they made a covenant in Beersheva, and Avimelech arose, and Phichol, the captain of his host, and they returned to the land of the Philistines.
21:33	And he planted a fruit grove in Beersheva, and he called there in the name of the L rd, the G d of the world. [As a result of that fruit grove the L rd came to be called the G d of the whole world, Abraham charging his guests to bless the Creator of the whole world, whose fruits they had eaten.]
21:34	And Abraham lived in the land of the Philistines many days [(twenty-six years, one year more than he had lived in Chevron)].
22
22:1	And it was, after these things, that G d proved Abraham. He said to him: "Abraham," and he said: "Here I am" [ready to do Your bidding].
22:2	And He said: Take, I pray you, [(Stand firm for Me in this trial)] your son [(Abraham: I have two sons)], your only one [(Abraham: Each is the only one of his mother)], whom you love [(Abraham: I love them both)] — Isaac [(All this, so as not to overwhelm Abraham by springing the command upon him, and, also, to endear the mitzvah to him)], and go to the land of Moriah [Jerusalem], and bring him up there as a burnt-offering on one of the mountains that I shall indicate to you.
22:3	And Abraham arose early in the morning [in haste to perform the mitzvah], and he [himself] saddled his ass, and he took his two youths [Ishmael and Eliezer] with him, and Isaac his son; and he split wood for the burnt-offering, and he arose, and he went to the place which G d had designated to him.
22:4	On the third day, [(Abraham not being shown the place immediately so that it not be said that he was "stunned" into the sacrifice and that if he had had time to deliberate he would not have undertaken it)], Abraham lifted his eyes, and he saw the place from afar, [a cloud hovering over the mountain.]
22:5	And Abraham said to his youths: Abide here with the ass and I and the youth will go [a little way off] to this [place before us], and we will prostrate ourselves and we will return to you [(Abraham prophesying that they would return)].
22:6	And Abraham took the wood for the burnt-offering and placed it upon Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the kindling and the knife, and both went together [i.e., in the same spirit — Abraham, who knew, as happy as Isaac, who did not know].
22:7	And Isaac said to Abraham his father: And he said: "My father." And he said: "Here I am, my son." And he said: "Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt-offering?"
22:8	And Abraham said: G d will see to the lamb for the burnt-offering, [and if there is no lamb, then it will be] my son. And both went together [in the same spirit of happiness — even Isaac, who now knew that he was going to be slaughtered.]
22:9	And they came to the place which G d had indicated to him. And Abraham built the altar there and he arranged the wood. And he bound Isaac his son, [hands and feet tied behind him], and he placed him on the altar upon the wood.
22:10	And Abraham sent forth his hand and he took the knife to slaughter his son.
22:11	And an angel of the L rd called to him from heaven, saying: "Abraham, Abraham" [(the doubling connoting affection)]. And he said: "Here I am."
22:12	And He said: Do not stretch your hand forth to the youth, and do not do anything to him. For now I know [i.e., I can counter all objections to My election of you; for it is evident to all] that you are G d-fearing, not having spared your only son from Me.
22:13	And Abraham lifted his eyes and he saw, and, behold, a ram afterwards, [i.e., after the angel had said to him: "Do not stretch, etc."] caught in the thicket by its horns. And Abraham went and he took the ram and brought it up as a burnt-offering in place of his son [i.e., For each sacrificial act, he prayed: "May it be Your will to reckon it as if it were done to my son."]
22:14	And Abraham called the name of that place "The L rd will see" [i.e., He will choose for Himself that place for the reposing of His Shechinah and the sacrifice of offerings], of which [place] it will be said [in future generations]: "On this day in the mountain, the L rd shall appear."
22:15	And an angel of the L rd called to Abraham a second time from heaven.
22:16	And he said: I have sworn by My name, says the L rd, that because you have done this thing and not spared your son, your only one,
22:17	that bless shall I bless you [(one blessing for the father, one for the son)] and multiply will I multiply your seed [(one for the father, one for the son)], as the stars of the heavens and the sand on the seashore, and your seed shall inherit the gate of his foes.
22:18	And there will bless themselves in your seed all the nations of the earth, because you have hearkened to My voice.
22:19	And Abraham returned to his youths and they arose and went together to Beersheva, and Abraham sojourned in Beersheva [(on the way to Chevron)].
22:20	And it was after these things [(i.e., after Abraham's thoughts on the binding of Isaac, viz.: If he had been slaughtered, he would have died without children — I should have gotten him a wife)] that it was told to Abraham: Milkah, she, too, has borne sons to Nachor your brother [i.e., Her family, too, is similar to that of Abraham. Just as twelve tribes issued from Abraham by way of Jacob — eight from the principal wives and four from the concubines — here, too, there were eight sons from the principal wife and four from the concubine.]
22:21	Utz, his firstborn and Buz, his brother, and Kemuel, the father of Aram.
22:22	And Kessed and Chazzo and Pildash and Yidlaf and Bethuel.
22:23	And Bethuel begot Rivkah [(The entire genealogy was recorded for the sake of this verse)]. These eight were borne by Milkah to Nachor the brother of Abraham.
22:24	And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she, too, bore: Tevach and Gacham and Tachash and Ma'achah.
Chayei Sarah
23
23:1	And the life of Sarah was a hundred years and twenty years [(Just as she had not sinned by twenty, sin liability not obtaining until that age, so she had not sinned by one hundred)], and seven years [(She was as beautiful at twenty as she was at seven)], the years of the life of Sarah [All were uniform in goodness.]
23:2	And Sarah died in Kiryath Arbah [("the city of the four" — so called either because of the four giants who lived there, or because of the four pairs who are buried there — Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rivkah, Jacob and Leah)], which is Chevron, in the land of Canaan. And Abraham came [from Beersheva] to eulogize Sarah and to bewail her.
23:3	And Abraham arose from before his dead one, and he spoke to the sons of Cheth, saying:
23:4	A stranger [from a different land] and a dweller am I with you. Give me a (land) holding for a burial plot with you so that I may bury my dead one from before me.
23:5	And the sons of Cheth answered Abraham, saying to him:
23:6	Hear us, my lord, you are a prince of G d in our midst. In the choicest of our plots bury your dead one; none of us will hold back his plot from you from burying your dead one.
23:7	And Abraham arose and he prostrated himself to the people of the land, to the sons of Cheth.
23:8	And he spoke to them, saying: If it is your will to bury my dead one from before me, hear me and petition Efron the son of Tzochar for me.
23:9	And let him give me the doubled cave [(so called because it had an upper and a lower story or because it was "doubled with pairs")], which he has, which is at the end of his field. For its full value let him give it (i.e., sell it) to me, in your midst as holding for a burial plot.
23:10	And Efron was sitting in the midst of the sons of Cheth, [having that day been appointed an officer in consideration of Abraham's being beholden to him]. And Efron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the sons of Cheth, for all who had come to the gate of his city [(All had left their work to come to pay respect to Sarah)], saying:
23:11	No, my lord, [do not pay for it], hear me. The field — I have given it to you; and the cave that is in it, to you have I given it. Before the eyes of the sons of my people have I given it to you — bury your dead one.
23:12	And Abraham prostrated himself before the people of the land.
23:13	And he spoke to Efron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying: But if you would only hear me. I have set aside the money for the field — take it from me and let me bury my dead one there.
23:14	And Efron answered Abraham, saying to him:
23:15	My lord, hear me. Land worth four hundred shekels of silver, between [lovers like] you and me, what is it? [Forget about it] and bury your dead one.
23:16	And Abraham hearkened to Efron, and Abraham weighed out to Efron the silver whereof he had spoken in the ears of the sons of Cheth, four hundred shekels of silver, current with the merchant.
23:17	And the field of Efron which was in the Machpelah before Mamre — the field and the cave therein and all the trees in the field in all its boundaries roundabout — was confirmed
23:18	to Abraham as an acquisition before the eyes of the sons of Cheth, before all who entered the gate of his city.
23:19	And after that, Abraham buried Sarah, his wife, in the cave of the field of the Machpelah, before Mamre, which is Chevron in the land of Canaan.
23:20	And the field and the cave therein were confirmed to Abraham as a burial holding from the sons of Cheth.
24
24:1	And Abraham was old, "come into the days," and the L rd had blessed Abraham with everything [bakol, the gematria of ben (a son) — whence the need to find a wife for him].
24:2	And Abraham said to his bondsman, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that was his. Place your hand beneath my thigh. [One who takes an oath must hold a sacred object in his hand. Circumcision, being Abraham's first mitzvah, and having been attended by pain, and being beloved by him, Abraham bade him take hold there.]
24:3	And I will beswear you by the L rd, the G d of the heavens and the G d of the earth, that you not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaani, in whose midst I dwell.
24:4	But to my land and to my birthplace shall you go, and you shall take a wife for my son Isaac.
24:5	And the bondsman said to him: Perchance the woman will not want to go after me to this land. Shall I return your son to the land whence you came?
24:6	And Abraham said to him: Take heed unto yourself lest you return my son there.
24:7	The L rd, the G d of the heavens [(whereas above [3] we have: "the G d of the heavens and the G d of the earth," Abraham having taught men to regard Him as such)], who took me out of my father's house [Charan] and from the land of my birth [Ur Kasdim], and who spoke concerning me [i.e., in my behalf] and who swore to me [at the covenant between the pieces (15:18)]: "To your children will I give this land"] — He shall send his angel before you, and you will take a wife for my son from there.
24:8	And if the woman does not want to go after you, then you will be clean of this oath of mine [and take a wife for him from the daughters of Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre]; only my son do not return there. [But Jacob, the son of my son, is destined to return there.]
24:9	And the bondsman placed his hand under the thigh of Abraham, his master, and he swore to him concerning this thing.
24:10	And the bondsman took ten camels of his master's camels, [distinctively his master's in being muzzled against grazing in the fields of others], and he went, and all of the good of his master in his hand, [i.e., a deed of gift to Isaac of all that he owned, so that they "jump" at sending their daughter]. And he arose and he went to Aram Naharayim [lit., "Aram of the two rivers," it being situated between two rivers], to the city of Nachor.
24:11	And he made his camels kneel outside the city by a well of water towards evening, at the time that the (women) water-drawers go out.
24:12	And he said: O L rd, G d of my master, Abraham; make it chance, I pray you, before me today, and do lovingkindness with my master, Abraham.
24:13	Behold, I stand by the well of water, and the daughters of the men of the city go out to draw water.
24:14	And the maiden to whom I shall say: "Incline, I pray you, your pitcher, that I may drink," and who shall answer: "Drink, and your camels, too, shall I give to drink" — her have You chosen for Your servant Isaac, and, let me know, [I pray You], through her, [by her being of his family and fit for him], that You have done lovingkindness with my master.
24:15	And it was, before he had finished speaking, and, behold, Rivkah came out, who had been born to Bethuel the son of Milkah, the wife of Nachor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder.
24:16	And the maiden was very beautiful, a virgin, and no man had known her [pederastically], and she went down to the well, and she filled up her pitcher, and she went up.
24:17	And the bondsman ran towards her, [having seen the waters rising towards her], and he said: Let me sip, I pray you, a little water from your pitcher.
24:18	And she said: "Drink, my lord." And she hastened and she brought down her pitcher [from her shoulder] upon her hand, and she gave him to drink.
24:19	And she finished giving him to drink, and she said: Also for your camels shall I draw, until they have finished drinking.
24:20	And she hastened, and she poured out her pitcher into the trough, and she ran again to the well to draw water, and she drew for all of his camels.
24:21	And the man looked in wonderment at her, keeping silent to know whether the L rd had prospered his way [by her being of Abraham's family] or not.
24:22	And it was, when the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a golden nose ring, a beka in weight [(intimating the shekels of Israel, "a beka (half-shekel) for a head" (Exodus 28:36)], and (placed) two clasps on her hands [(intimating the two "clasped" tablets of the Law)], ten (shekels of) gold their weight [(intimating the Ten Commandments)].
24:23	And he said: Whose daughter are you? Tell me, I pray you. Is there place for us in your father's house for a night's lodging?
24:24	And she said to him, [answering first things first]: I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milkah, whom she bore to Nachor.
24:25	And she said to him: Both straw and provender [(camel feed)] are abundant with us, also a place for [many nights] lodgings.
24:26	And the man bowed down and he prostrated himself to the L rd.
24:27	And he said: Blessed is the L rd, the G d of my master Abraham, who did not leave off His lovingkindness and His truth from my master. I, in the way [that I required], the L rd has guided me, to the house of my master's brethren.
24:28	And the maiden ran and she told of these things in her mother's house.
24:29	And Rivkah had a brother, and his name was Lavan, and Lavan ran to the man outside, to the well.
24:30	And it was, when he saw the nose ring and the clasps on his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rivkah his sister: "Thus spoke the man to me" [that he ran, etc.], and he came to the man, and, behold, he was standing over the camels [to watch them] at the well.
24:31	And he said: Come, blessed of the L rd. Why do you stand outside? I have cleaned the house [of idolatry] and (made) a place for the camels.
24:32	And the man came into the house and he unmuzzled the camels, and he gave straw and provender to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
24:33	And food was placed before him, and he said: "I shall not eat until I have spoken my words." And he said: "Speak."
24:34	And he said: I am the bondsman of Abraham.
24:35	And the L rd blessed my master greatly, and he prospered. And He gave him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and bondsmen and bondswomen, and camels and asses.
24:36	And Sarah, the wife of my master, bore a son to my master after she had become old, and he gave him all that was his. [He showed him the deed of gift.]
24:37	And my master beswore me, saying: Do not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaani, in whose land I dwell.
24:38	Unless you go [first] to my father's house and to my family [and she refuse to go with you], and you shall take a wife for my son.
24:39	And I said to my master: Perchance the woman will not want to go after me.
24:40	And he said to me: The L rd, before whom I have walked, He will send His angel with you and He will prosper your way, and you shall take a wife for my son from my family and from my father's house.
24:41	Then you will be clean of my oath — when you come to my family. And if they do not give (her) to you, you will be clean of my oath.
24:42	And I came this day [that I started out], to the well, [G d having "shrunk the way" for me], and I said; O L rd, G d of my master Abraham — If You now prosper my way upon which I go,
24:43	Behold, I stand by the well of water, and, the maiden who goes out to draw, and I say to her: "Give me to drink, I pray you, a little water from your pitcher,"
24:44	and she will say to me: "You, too, [including the men who are with you] drink, and also for your camels will I draw" — she is the woman whom the L rd has chosen for my master's son.
24:45	I, before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rivkah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder, and she went down to the well and she drew; and I said to her: "Give me to drink, I pray you."
24:45	And she hastened, and she lowered her pitcher from her (shoulder), and she said: "Drink, and also your camels will I water." And I drank, and she also watered the camels.
24:47	And I asked her: "Whose daughter are you?" And she said: "The daughter of Bethuel, the son of Nachor, whom Milkah bore to him." And I placed the ring on her nose and the clasps on her hands. [He changed the true order (placing-asking, 24:22-23), so that he not be "interrogated" on how he could have given before knowing who she was.]
24:48	And I bowed down and I prostrated myself to the L rd, and I blessed the L rd, the G d of my master, Abraham, who led me in the way of truth, to take the daughter of my master's brother for his son.
24:49	And now, if you would do lovingkindness and truth with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me. And I will turn to the right [to the daughters of Ishmael] or to the left [to the daughters of Lot].
24:50	And Lavan and Bethuel answered. [Lavan, the wicked one, "jumping" to answer before his father]: From the L rd has the thing gone forth. We cannot speak to you [in refusal] ill or good.
24:51	Behold, Rivkah is before you, take (her) and go; and let her be a wife to your master's son, as the L rd has spoken.
24:52	And it was, when Abraham's bondsman heard their words, that he bowed to the ground to the L rd, [acknowledging good tidings].
24:53	And the bondsman took out vessels of silver and vessels of gold and garments, and he gave them to Rivkah; and select fruits [from Eretz Yisrael] he gave to her brother and to her mother.
24:54	And they ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and they stayed overnight, and they arose in the morning; and he said: Send me to my master.
24:55	And her brother and her mother [(Bethuel, who wanted to renege, having been killed by an angel)] said: Let the maiden remain with us a year or ten months; after that, let her go.
24:56	And he said to them: Do not delay me when the L rd has prospered my way. Send me and let me go to my master.
24:57	And they said: Let us call the maiden and ask her [if she consents].
24:58	And they called Rivkah and they said to her: Will you go with this man? And she said: I shall go, [even against your will].
24:59	And they sent Rivkah their sister and her nurse, and Abraham's bondsman and his men.
24:60	And they blessed Rivkah and they said to her: Our sister, may you [and not another woman be destined to receive the blessing given to Abraham on Mount Moriah (22:17). May you] become thousands of myriads, and may your seed inherit the gate of its foes [Ibid.]
24:61	And Rivka and her maidens arose and they rode on the camels and they went after the man. And the bondsman took Rivkah and he went.
24:62	And Isaac had just come from Be'er Lachai Ro'i [(16:14) having gone there to bring Hagar back to Abraham as a wife], and he dwelt in the land of the south.
24:63	And Isaac went to pray in the field towards evening, and he lifted up his eyes and he saw, and, behold, camels coming.
24:64	And Rivkah lifted her eyes, and she saw Isaac [in his grandness], and she slid from the camel.
24:65	And she said to the bondsman: Who is this man walking in the field towards us? And the bondsman said: He is my master. And she took the veil and covered herself.
24:66	And the bondsman told Isaac all the things that he had done [i.e., all the miracles that had been wrought for him.]
24:67	And Isaac brought her into the tent, [and she was in stead of] Sarah, his mother [(various miraculous phenomena which had ceased there with Sarah's death, recurring now)]. And she became his wife, and he loved her. And Isaac was consoled after his mother.
25
25:1	And Abraham married again, a woman [Hagar], who was called Keturah.
25:2	And she bore unto him Zimran and Yakshan and Medan and Midyan and Yishbak and Shuach.
25:3	And Yakshan begot Sheva and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were [the heads of the peoples:] Ashurim, Letushim, and Leumim.
25:4	And the sons of Midyan: Eifah and Efer and Chanoch and Avida and Elda'ah — all these the sons of Keturah.
25:5	And Abraham gave all that he had [i.e., the legacy of blessing] to Isaac.
25:6	And to the sons of the concubine [Hagar] which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts. And he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he was still alive, eastward, to the land of the east.
25:7	And these are the years of Abraham's life, which he lived: a hundred years and seventy years, and five years. [A hundred like seventy, and seventy like five — without sin.]
25:8	And Abraham expired, and he died in a good old age, old and content; and he was gathered to his people.
25:9	And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him [(Ishmael, having repented, granting precedence to Isaac)] in the doubled cave in the field of Efron the son of Tzochar, which is before Mamre.
25:10	The field which Abraham bought from the sons of Cheth. There was Abraham buried, and Sarah, his wife.
25:11	And it was, after the death of Abraham, that G d blessed Isaac his son [(the mourners' consolation)]. And Isaac dwelt at Be'er Lachai Ro'i.
25:12	And these are the progeny of Ishmael, the son of Abraham, whom Hagar the Egyptian, the bondswoman of Sarah, bore to Abraham.
25:13	And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael by their names in order of birth: the first-born of Ishmael — Nevayoth — and Kedar, and Adbel, and Mivsam.
25:14	And Mishma and Suma and Massa.
25:15	Chadad and Tema, Yetur, Nafish, and Kedmah.
25:16	These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their courts [unwalled cities] and by their strongholds — twelve princes according to their nations.
25:17	And these are the years of the life of Ishmael: a hundred years, and thirty years, and seven years. And he expired [in righteousness] and he died, and he was gathered to his people.
25:18	And they dwelt from Chavilah until Shur, which is before Egypt on the way to Ashur. In the presence of all his brethren he dwelt.
Toldoth
25:19	And these [(Jacob and Esau)] are the progeny of Isaac the son of Abraham. Abraham begot Isaac [i.e., After he was called "Abraham," he begot Isaac].
25:20	And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rivkah the daughter of Bethuel the Aramite [(an evildoer)] from Padan Aram [(a place of evildoers)], the sister of Lavan the Aramite [(an evildoer)] to himself as a wife, [(Rivkah retaining her integrity in spite of the above associations)].
25:21	And Isaac entreated the L rd, [praying] opposite his wife, for she was barren. And the L rd was entreated of him, [(but not of her, the prayer of a righteous child of a wicked father not being comparable to that of a righteous child of a righteous father)], and Rivkah his wife conceived.
25:22	And the children wrangled within her, and she said: If so [great is the pain of pregnancy], why (did) I [so much desire and pray for] this? And she went [to the school of Shem] to inquire of the L rd [as to what was portended for her.]
25:23	And the L rd said to her [through Shem]: Two nations are in your womb, and two kingdoms from your innards shall part, [one to do evil, the other to do good], and one kingdom shall gain strength from the other, [i.e., As one falls, the other shall rise], and the elder shall serve the younger.
25:24	And her days were filled to give birth, and, behold, there were twins in her womb.
25:25	And the first one came out ruddy, all like a hairy cloak, and they called his name Esau ["all made" (i.e., complete)].
25:26	And after his brother went out, his hand grasping Esau's heel (akev), [(portending his seizure of Esau's kingdom before its consummation)], and he called his name Yaakov. And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.
25:27	And when the youths grew up, Esau became a man versed in deception, a man of the field [i.e., a hunter], and Jacob a whole (-hearted) man, a dweller of tents [i.e., of (the schools of) Shem and Ever].
25:28	And Isaac loved Esau, for [Esau "placed"] venison in his mouth, and Rivkah loved Jacob.
25:29	And Jacob cooked a pottage, and Esau came from the field and he was faint [with murder.]
25:30	And Esau said to Jacob: "Pour down (my throat) some of this red (adom) red stuff, for I am faint" — wherefore his name was called Edom.
25:31	And Jacob said: Sell [as "clearly"] as the day [is clear] your birthright to me. [An evildoer such as you is not worthy of the sacrificial service (which is the prerogative of the first-born.)]
25:32	And Esau said: Behold, I am going to die. What need have I, then, of this birthright?
25:33	And Jacob said: Swear to me as the day [is clear]. And he swore to him, and he sold his birthright to Jacob.
25:34	And Jacob gave to Esau bread and a pottage of lentils. And he ate, and he drank, and he arose, and he went, and [(Scripture testifying to this effect)] Esau shamed the birthright.
26
26:1	And there was a famine in the land, aside from the first famine in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Avimelech, king of the Philistines, to Gerar.
26:2	And the L rd appeared to him and said: Do not go down to Egypt, [for you are a "pure burnt-offering"]; dwell in the land that I shall indicate to you.
26:3	Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and I will bless you. For to you and to your seed will I give all of these lands. And I will fulfill the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.
26:4	And I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens, and I will give to your seed all of these lands, and there will bless themselves in [the name of] your seed all the nations of the land.
26:5	Because Abraham heeded My voice [when I tried him], and he kept My keeping [i.e., decrees for the safekeeping of the exhortations of the Torah], My mitzvoth [self-evident moral imperatives], My statutes [decrees inaccessible to reason], and My laws [(including the oral law)].
26:6	And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.
26:7	And the men of the place asked about his wife, and he said: "She is my sister." For he feared to say: "She is my wife," lest the men of the place kill me because of Rivkah, for she is very fair.
26:8	And it was, when the days were grown long for him there, [Isaac thinking that Rivkah was no longer in danger and relaxing his vigil], that Avimelech the king of the Philistines looked through the window, and behold, Isaac sporting [i.e., lying] with Rivkah his wife.
26:9	And Avimelech called to Isaac and he said: But she is surely your wife! How, then, did you tell me: "She is my sister"? And Isaac said to him: For I said: Lest I die because of her.
26:10	And Avimelech said: What is this that you have done to us? The [distinctive] one of the people [i.e., the king] had almost lain with your wife, and, [had he done so], you would have brought guilt upon us.
26:11	And Avimelech commanded all the people, saying: Whoever touches this man or his wife shall be put to death.
26:12	And Isaac sowed in that land [(though it was not so fertile as the land of the seven nations)], and he found in that year, [a difficult year], a hundredfold [more than the estimated yield]. And the L rd blessed him.
26:13	And the man grew (i.e., prospered), and he continued growing, until he had grown exceedingly.
26:14	And he had flocks of sheep and herds of cattle and much labor, and the Philistines envied him.
26:15	And all of the wells that the servants of his father had dug in the days of Abraham, his father, were stopped up by the Philistines [(as abetting invading armies)], and they filled them up with sand.
26:16	And Avimelech said to Isaac: Go away from us, for you have grown much stronger than we.
26:17	And Isaac went thence, and he camped in the valley of Gerar, and he dwelt there.
26:18	And Isaac returned [(before he left Gerar)] and dug the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father and which the Philistines had stopped up after the death of Abraham. And he called them by the names by which his father had called them.
26:19	And the servants of Isaac dug in the valley, and they found there a well of living waters.
26:20	And the shepherds of Gerar quarreled with the shepherds of Isaac, saying: "The water is ours!" And he called the name of the well Esek ("contention"), for they contended with him [over it].
26:21	And they dug another well, and they quarreled over it, too, and they called its name Sitnah ("constraint").
26:22	And he traveled from there, and he dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it; and he called its name Rechovoth ("widening"), saying: For now the L rd has "widened" (things) for us, and we will be fruitful in the land.
26:23	And he went up from there to Beersheva.
26:24	And the L rd appeared to him that night, and He said: I am the G d of Abraham your father. Do not fear, for I am with you. And I shall bless you and I shall multiply your seed for the sake of Abraham, My servant.
26:25	And he built an altar there, and he called in the name of the L rd. And he pitched his tent there, and the servants of Isaac dug a well there.
26:26	And Avimelech went to him from Gerar and a company of his friends and Phichol the captain of his host.
26:27	And Isaac said to them: Why have you come to me when you hate me and you sent me away from you?
26:28	And they said: We saw [in you as] we saw [in your father] that the L rd was with you. And we said: Let the oath that was between us [from the days of your father, also] be between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you.
26:29	That you do not evil to us just as we did not touch you and just as we did with you only good and we sent you away in peace. You [too, do] now [likewise unto us], O blessed of the L rd.
26:30	And he made a feast for them, and they ate and drank.
26:31	And they arose early in the morning, and they swore to each other, and Isaac sent them away, and they went from him in peace.
26:32	And it was on that day that the servants of Isaac came and told him about the well they had dug; and they said to him: We have found water.
26:33	And he called it Shivah ("covenanting"). Therefore, the name of the city is Beersheva ("the well of the covenant") until this day.
26:34	And when Esau was forty years, he took as a wife Yehudith, the daughter of Be'eri the Hittite, and Basmath, the daughter of Eilon the Hittite.
26:35	And they were a vexation of spirit to Isaac and to Rivkah [in that they served idolatry].
27
27:1	And it was, when Isaac became old, that his eyes grew dulled from seeing. And he called to Esau, his elder son, saying to him: "My son." And he said to him: "Here I am."
27:2	And he said: Behold, I have become old; I do not know the day of my death.
27:3	And now, take [(also connoting "sharpen")] I pray you, your knives [for shechitah (ritual slaughter)], your sword and your bow, and go out into the field, and hunt me a hunting, [and not theft].
27:4	And make me the kind of tasty dish that I like, and bring it to me and I shall eat it, so that my soul bless you before I die.
27:5	And Rivkah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son, and Esau went to the field to hunt a hunting to bring [by theft, if "hunting" were not available].
27:6	And Rivkah said to Jacob her son: Behold, I have overheard your father saying to your brother Esau:
27:7	Bring me a hunting and make me savory food, and I shall eat, and I shall bless you before the L rd [i.e., by His leave] before my death.
27:8	And now, my son, hearken to my voice, to what I command you.
27:9	Go, now, to the flock, and take for me [(from what is mine)] from there two good goat kids, [one for a paschal offering, and one for a savory dish], and I shall make of them for your father the kind of tasty dish that he likes [(kid, tasting like venison)].
27:10	And bring it to your father and have him eat, so that he bless you before his death.
27:11	And Jacob said to Rivkah, his mother: But Esau my brother is hairy and I am smooth-skinned.
27:12	Perchance my father will feel me and I shall be in his eyes as a deceiver, and I will bring upon myself a curse and not a blessing!
27:13	And his mother said to him: Your curse upon me, my son; only hear my voice and go take (them) for me.
27:14	And he went and took (them) and brought (them) to his mother. And his mother made the kind of tasty dish that his father liked.
27:15	And Rivkah took the clean garments of Esau, her elder son, which were with her [for safe-keeping] in the house, and she clothed Jacob her younger son with them.
27:16	And the skins of the goat-kids she placed upon his hands and the smooth of his neck.
27:17	And she placed the tasty dish and the bread that she had made in the hand of her son Jacob.
27:18	And he brought (it) to his father, and he said: "My father." And he said: "I am here. Who are you, my son?"
27:19	And Jacob said to his father: I am [(the one bringing food to you, and)] Esau [is] your first-born. I have done [(many things)] as you have spoken to me. Arise, I pray you, and sit [at table] and eat of my hunting so that your soul bless me.
27:20	And Isaac said to his son: How did you find (it) so quickly, my son? And he said: For the L rd your G d put it in my way.
27:21	And Isaac said to Jacob: Come near and let me feel you, my son, [(Isaac having been surprised at the reply, atypical of Esau)]. Are you my son Esau or not?
27:22	And Jacob drew near to Isaac his father, and he felt him, and he said: The voice [i.e., the tone, e.g., "Arise, I pray you"] is the voice of Jacob [(as opposed to Esau's brusque "Let my father arise")], but the hands are the hands of Esau.
27:23	And he did not recognize him, for his hands were like the hands of Esau his brother, hairy, and he blessed him.
27:24	And he said: Are you this, my son Esau? And he said: "I" [(but not: "I am Esau.")]
27:25	And he said: Reach (it) to me, and I will eat of the hunting of my son, so that my soul bless you. And he reached (it) to him, and he ate, and he brought him wine and he drank.
27:26	And Isaac his father said to him: Draw near, now, and kiss me, my son.
27:27	And he drew near and he kissed him and he smelled the smell of his garments [into which the fragrance of Eden had entered], and he blessed him. And he said: See, the smell of my son is as that of a field [of apples] which the L rd has blessed.
27:28	And may G d give you [in addition to the fragrance of Eden] of the dew of the heavens and the fat of the earth, and an abundance of corn and wine.
27:29	Peoples will serve you, and nations will bow down to you. Be a master to your brothers, and your mother's sons will bow down to you. Your cursers will be cursed and your blessers will be blessed.
27:30	And it was, when Isaac finished blessing Jacob — Jacob had just left the presence of Isaac his father, when Esau his brother came from his hunting.
27:31	And he, too, made a savory dish and brought it to his father. And he said to his father: Let my father arise and eat from the hunting of his son, so that your soul bless me.
27:32	And Isaac his father said to him: Who are you? And he said: I am your first-born son, Esau.
27:33	And Isaac was greatly confounded, and he said: Who is it, then, that hunted a hunting and brought it to me and I ate all [the flavors that I desired] before you came, and I blessed him — and he will, indeed, be blessed.
27:34	When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried a great and bitter outcry, and he said to his father: Bless me also, my father!
27:35	And he said: Your brother came with subtlety and took your blessing.
27:36	And he said: "Is it for this that he was called 'Yaakov' ('following at the heels')? That he would overtake me (ya'akveini) these two times? He took my birthright, and, behold, now he has taken my blessing!" And he said: "Did you not keep back a blessing for me?"
27:37	And Isaac answered and he said to Esau: I made him a master over you, and all of his brothers have I given to him as bondsmen [and "whatever a bondsman acquires is acquired by his master"], and with corn and wine have I buttressed him, and for you, then, what can I do, my son?
27:38	And Esau said to his father: Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me, too, my father. And Esau raised his voice and wept.
27:39	And Isaac his father answered and he said to him: Behold, of the fats of the earth [Graeca Magna] will be your dwelling, and of the dew of the heavens from above.
27:40	And by your sword will you live, and your brother will you serve. And it shall be when you [have just reason to] grieve [over the blessings' having been appropriated by Jacob (i.e., when Israel transgresses the Torah)], then you shall remove his yoke from your neck.
27:41	And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing that his father had given him, and Esau said in his heart; Let the days of mourning for my father draw near, and I will [then] kill Jacob my brother [(and not before, so as not to aggrieve my father)].
27:42	And it was told to Rivkah [through the holy spirit] the thoughts of Esau her elder son, and she sent and called to Jacob her younger son and said to him: Behold, Esau your brother is bethinking himself [of his brotherhood] to you, to kill you.
27:43	And now, my son, hearken to my voice. Arise, and run away to Lavan my brother in Charan.
27:44	And remain with him for some time, until your brother's fury is abated.
27:45	Until your brother's wrath turns from you and he forgets what you did to him, when I will send and take you from there. Why should I be bereft of both of you [(one killing, the other being killed in revenge)] in one day [(a presage of the future, Isaac and Esau being buried on the same day)] (See Sotah 13a).
27:46	And Rivkah said to Isaac: I have despised my life because of the daughters of Cheth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Cheth such as these of the daughters of the land, what is life to me?
28
28:1	And Isaac called to Jacob and he blessed him, and he charged him, saying: Do not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.
28:2	Arise, go to Padan-Aram, to the house of Bethuel, your mother's father, and take for yourself from there a wife from the daughters of Lavan, your mother's brother.
28:3	And the G d who is All-Sufficient [in His blessings] will bless you. And He will make you fruitful and will multiply you, and you will be an assembly of peoples.
28:4	And He will give you [i.e., there will issue from you] the blessing of [i.e., to] Abraham [(12:2): "And I shall make you a great nation" and (26:4): "And they will bless themselves in your seed"], to you and to your seed with you, to inherit the land of your sojournings which G d gave to Abraham.
28:5	And Isaac sent Jacob, and he went to Padan-Aram, to Lavan the son of Bethuel the Aramite, the brother of Rivkah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.
28:6	And Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and that he had sent him to Padan-Aram to take for himself from there a wife in blessing him, charging him: Do not take wife from the daughters of Canaan,
28:7	and that Jacob had heeded his father and mother and gone to Padan-Aram.
28:8	And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the eyes of Isaac his father.
28:9	And Esau [likewise] went to Ishmael, and he took Machlath the daughter of Ishmael, the son of Abraham, the sister of Nevayoth [(who gave her in marriage to Esau)] in addition to his (other) [wicked] wives for himself as a wife.
Vayetze
28:10	And Jacob went out of Beersheva and he went [to go] to Charan.
28:11	And he came to the place [Mount Moriah] and he spent the night there, for the sun had set [of a sudden, G d causing it to set so that he should sleep there]. And he took of the stones of the place and set them around his head [to guard against animals], and he slept in that place.
28:12	And he dreamed, and, behold, a ladder set in the earth, and its top reaching the heavens, and, behold, angels of G d ascending [to heaven] and [others] descending [from heaven to earth] upon it.
28:13	And, behold, the L rd was standing over him [to guard him]. And He said: I am the L rd, the G d of Abraham your father, and the G d of Isaac. The land on which you lie, to you shall I give it, and to your seed.
28:14	And your seed will be as dust of the earth, and you will be strong, west and east and north and south. And all the families of the earth will bless themselves in you and in your seed.
28:15	And, behold, I am with you, [and you need not fear Esau and Lavan], and I shall keep you, wherever you go, and I shall return you to this land; for I shall not forsake you until I have done what I have spoken [to Abraham] concerning you.
28:16	And Jacob awoke from his sleep and he said: In truth, the L rd is in this place, and I did not know it. [Had I known it, I would not have slept here.]
28:17	And he feared and he said: How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of G d, and this is the gate of heaven [a place of prayer, whence prayers ascend to heaven].
28:18	And Jacob arose early in the morning and he took the stone that he had placed at his head and he set it up as a monument and he poured oil on its top.
28:19	And he called the name of that place Beth-El ("the house of G d"), whereas Luz had been the name of the city in the beginning.
28:20	And Jacob vowed a vow, saying: If G d will be with me, [as He promised (28:15)], and He will keep me on this way on which I go, [as He said (Ibid.)], and He will give me bread to eat and a garment to wear, [as He said (Ibid.): "For I shall not forsake you"],
28:21	and I return in peace [free of sin] to my father's house, [as He said (Ibid.)], and the L rd will be a G d for me, [conferring His name upon me, there being no blemish in my seed, as He said (Ibid.): "what I have spoken concerning you," viz. (17:17): "to be a G d to you and to your seed after you"],
28:22	then this stone which I have set up as a pillar will be the house of G d [i.e., I shall worship the L rd upon it (as he did, viz. 35:1 and 14)], and all that You give me will I tenth to You.
29
29:1	And Jacob lifted his feet [on the "strength" of the glad tidings], and he went to the land of the children of the east.
29:2	And he saw, and, behold, a well in the field, and, behold, three flocks of sheep resting near it; for from that well they [the shepherds] would water the flocks, and a great stone on the mouth of the well.
29:3	And all the flocks would gather there and they would roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep, and they would return the stone to its place on the mouth of the well.
29:4	And Jacob said to them: My brothers, whence do you come? And they said: We are from Charan.
29:5	And he said to them: Do you know Lavan the son of Nachor? And they said: We know.
29:6	And he said to them: Is he well? And they said: Well, and, behold, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep.
29:7	And he said: The day is yet long; it is not time to gather in the kine; water the sheep and go and graze.
29:8	And they said: We will not be able to do so until all the flocks are gathered and they [the shepherds] roll the stone from the mouth of the well and we water the sheep.
29:9	He was yet speaking with them when Rachel came with her father's sheep (for she was a shepherdess).
29:10	And it was, when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Lavan, his mother's brother, and the sheep of Lavan, his mother's brother, that Jacob came forward and flipped the stone from the mouth of the well and watered the sheep of Lavan, his mother's brother.
29:11	And Jacob kissed Rachel and he lifted up his voice and cried, [seeing prophetically that she would not be buried with him].
29:12	And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's kin and Rivkah's son, and she ran and told it to her father, [her mother having died].
29:13	And it was, when Lavan heard the talk of Jacob, his sister's son, that he ran towards him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house; and he told Lavan all of these things.
29:14	And Lavan said to him: But, [though you come empty-handed], you are my bone and flesh. And he stayed with him a month of days.
29:15	And Lavan said to Jacob: Is it because you are my brother that you would serve me for nought? Tell me what your wage is.
29:16	And Lavan had two daughters: the name of the elder, Leah, and the name of the younger, Rachel.
29:17	And the eyes of Leah were soft, and Rachel was of beautiful [facial] form and of beautiful [facial] appearance.
29:18	And Jacob loved Rachel, and he said: I shall serve you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter, [(Jacob making assurance doubly sure — and being deceived nonetheless)].
29:19	And Lavan said: It is better for me to give her to you than to give her to another man; stay with me.
29:20	And Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they were in his eyes like several days in his love for her.
29:21	And Jacob said to Lavan: Give me my wife, for my days have been completed, and let me come to her [and beget children (the twelve tribes)].
29:22	And Lavan gathered all the men of the place and he made a feast.
29:23	And it was in the evening that he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him, and he lived with her.
29:24	And Lavan gave her Zilpah, his handmaid, to Leah his daughter, as a handmaid.
29:25	And it was in the morning, and, behold, it is Leah! [(Rachel having given to Leah the "identity signs" that Jacob had given her, so that Leah not be shamed)]. And he said to Lavan: What is this that you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why have you deceived me!
29:26	And Lavan said: It is not done thus in our place to give the younger daughter before the elder.
29:27	Fulfill the [festal] week of this one (Leah), and we will give you this one, too, [(after the festal week, Jacob's service beginning after the wedding)] for the service you will render me yet another seven years.
29:28	And Jacob did thus, and he fulfilled the week of that one, and he gave him Rachel his daughter as a wife.
29:29	And Lavan gave to Rachel his daughter, Bilhah his handmaid, to her as a handmaid.
29:30	And he came also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and he served him yet another seven years, [as devotedly as the first].
29:31	And the L rd saw that Leah was hated, and He opened her womb; and Rachel was barren.
29:32	And Leah conceived and she bore a son, and she called his name Reuven, saying: For the L rd has seen (ra'ah Hashem) my affliction; for now my husband will love me.
29:33	And she conceived again and she bore a son, and she said: For the L rd has heard (shama Hashem) that I am hated, and He has given me this one, too. And she called his name Shimon.
29:34	And she conceived again and she bore a son, and she said: This time my husband will join himself (yilaveh) to me, for I have borne him three sons [my share of the twelve tribes (among his four wives)]. Therefore, he called his name Levi.
29:35	And she conceived again and she bore a son, and she said: This time, [having borne more than my share], I will thank (odeh) the L rd. Therefore, she called his name Yehudah. And she left off bearing.
30
30:1	And Rachel saw that she had not borne (a child) to Jacob, and Rachel envied her sister, [thinking that if Leah were not more righteous than she, she, too, would not have borne], and she said to Jacob: "Give me children" [i.e., pray for me to bear children, as your father did for your mother], "and if not, I am dead."
30:2	And Jacob's wrath burned against Rachel, and he said: Am I in the place of G d, who has withheld from you [(but not from me)] the fruit of the womb?
30:3	And she said: Here is my handmaid Bilhah. Come to her and let her bear upon my knees, [i.e., I shall raise her child], and I, too, shall build up [i.e., bear a child] by cause of her, [(as Sarah did after she had given her handmaid Hagar to Abraham)].
30:4	And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid as a wife, and Jacob lived with her.
30:5	And Bilhah conceived and she bore a son to Jacob.
30:6	And Rachel said: G d judged me (danani) [and made me barren], and He also heard my plaint and gave me a son — wherefore she called his name Dan.
30:7	And she conceived again, and Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid, bore a second son to Jacob.
30:8	And Rachel said: [With many] importunities (naftulim) did I importune G d [to be equal] with my sister, and I also prevailed [i.e., He was also entreated of me], and she called his name Naftali.
30:9	And Leah saw that she had stopped bearing, and she took her handmaid Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
30:10	And Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, bore a son to Jacob.
30:11	And Leah said: "Bagad" ("Good fortune comes"), and she called his name Gad.
30:12	And Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, bore a second son to Jacob.
30:13	And Leah said: For my praise (be'ashri); for daughters will praise me. And she called his name Asher.
30:14	And Reuven went in the days of the wheat harvest, and he found violets in the field [(He took what was ownerless and not what had been harvested)], and he brought them to Leah his mother. And Rachel said to Leah: Give me of the violets of your son.
30:15	And she said to her: Is your taking my husband too little that you would also take the violets of my son? And Rachel said: Therefore, he will lie with you this night [(which was "Rachel's night")] in exchange for the violets of your son.
30:16	And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out towards him, and she said: To me shall you come, for I hired you with the violets of my son; and he lay with her in that night, He [i.e., The L rd, "aided," Issachar issuing from that union].
30:17	And G d hearkened unto Leah, [who aspired to multiply tribes], and she conceived and she bore a fifth son to Jacob.
30:18	And Leah said: G d has given my reward (s'chari) for having given my handmaid to my husband, and she called his name Issachar.
30:19	And Leah conceived again, and she bore a sixth son to Jacob.
30:20	And Leah said: The L rd has given me a goodly portion. Now my husband will consort with me (yizbeleni), for I have borne him six sons [(over and against all of his wives)]. And she called his name Zevulun.
30:21	And then she bore a daughter, and she called her name Dinah.
30:22	And G d remembered (it) unto Rachel [that she had given her "signs" to Leah and that she was distraught lest Esau take her], and G d hearkened unto her and He opened her womb.
30:23	And she conceived and she bore a son, and she said: G d has gathered in (asaf) my shame.
30:24	And she called his name Yosef, saying: May the L rd add ("yosef") unto me another son [(Rachel knowing prophetically that there would be only twelve tribes)].
30:25	And it was, when Rachel bore Joseph [the "adversary" of Esau (see Ovadiah 1:18)] that Jacob said to Lavan: Send me away, that I may go to my place and to my land.
30:26	Give me [by your leave] my wives and my children for whom I served you, and let me go. For you know the service which I have served you.
30:27	And Lavan said to him: If I have found favor in your eyes, I have found through divination that the L rd has blessed me for your sake.
30:28	And he said: State your wage and I will give it.
30:29	And he said to him: You know how I have served you and how [few] your kine were with me.
30:30	For the little that you had before has increased to a multitude, and the L rd has blessed you with my coming, and now, when will I also [in addition to my sons] do (what is needed) for my household?
30:31	And he said: What shall I give you? And Jacob said: You will not give me anything. If you do this thing for me, I will return and graze and guard your flock.
30:32	I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every sheep speckled and spotted, and every sheep, brownish among the flock, and the spotted and speckled among the goats, [these to be given to your sons], and that [i.e., those of the above kind born from now on] shall be my wage.
30:33	And my righteousness shall answer for me on the morrow. For it [my righteousness] will come [and testify] to my wage before you, [i.e.,] anything [which you find in my flock] that is not speckled and spotted among the goats or brownish among the sheep is stolen with me.
30:34	And Lavan said: Agreed! Would that you wished it so!
30:35	And he [Lavan] removed on that day the he-goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted — everything that had white in it — and everything that was brownish among the sheep, and he [Lavan] gave them into the hands of his sons.
30:36	And he put three days distance between himself and Jacob, and Jacob grazed the flock of Lavan that were left [i.e., the sickly and barren ones].
30:37	And Jacob took a moist stick of white poplar and [a stick of] almond and of chestnut, and he peeled them into white streaks, baring the white on the sticks.
30:38	And he set the sticks which he had peeled in the gutters of the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink, opposite the flocks, and they became heated when they came to drink [i.e., the female recoiled at the sight of the sticks and the male mated with her, and she bore in their likeness].
30:39	And the flocks became heated at the [sight of the] sticks [(as above)], and the flocks bore ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.
30:40	And Jacob separated the sheep [that were born ringstraked and spotted], and he set the face of the flock [that followed them] to the ringstraked and to all of the brownish [that he had found] in the flock of Lavan, having put them in flocks by themselves. And he did not place them with the flock of Lavan.
30:41	And it was, whenever the early (aroused) sheep became heated, that Jacob set the sticks before the eyes of the sheep in the gutters to become heated at [the sight of] the sticks. [see 38]
30:42	And when the sheep were late (to become heated), he did not set (them) — and the (offspring of the) late ones were Lavan's, and the early ones, Jacob's.
30:43	And the man (Jacob) grew exceedingly strong, and he had flocks [more] fruitful [than the norm], and [(by selling them at a high price)] maidservants, manservants, camels, and asses.
31
31:1	And he heard the words of the sons of Lavan, saying: Jacob has taken all that is our father's, and from our father's did he gather all this substance.
31:2	And Jacob saw the face of Lavan, and, behold, it was not with him as of yore.
31:3	And the L rd said to Jacob: Return to the land of your fathers and to your birthplace and I shall be with you, [it not being possible to repose my Shechinah with you while you are "linked to uncleanliness"].
31:4	And Jacob sent and he called to Rachel and to Leah to the field to his flock.
31:5	And he said to them: I see that your father's face is not with me as of yore; and my father's G d was with me.
31:6	And you know that with all my strength did I serve your father.
31:7	And your father deceived me and he changed my hire ten tens [i.e., a hundred times], but G d did not allow him to do evil with me.
31:8	If he said thus: "The speckled shall be your hire," then all the flocks bore speckled. And if he said thus: "The ringstraked shall be your hire," then all the flocks bore ringstraked.
31:9	And G d delivered the kine of your father and He gave them to me.
31:10	And it was, at the time the flocks were heated, I lifted up my eyes and I saw in a dream: Behold, the rams which went up on the sheep were ringstraked, speckled, and grizzled.
31:11	And an angel of G d said to me in a dream: "Jacob." And I said: "Here I am."
31:12	And he said: Lift up your eyes now and see all the rams that go up on the sheep — ringstraked, speckled, and grizzled — for I have seen all that Lavan does to you.
31:13	I am the G d of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar where you vowed a vow unto Me, [which it is now time to fulfill (see 28:22)]. Now, arise, go out of this land and return to the land of your birth.
31:14	And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him: Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house? [Why, then, should we detain you?]
31:15	Does he not regard us as strangers? For [he did not give us a dowry as is customary, but] he sold us [to you for your labor], and he also consumed our money, [withholding your wages].
31:16	But [only] all of the wealth that G d confiscated from our father is ours and our children's. And now, everything that G d says to you, do.
31:17	And Jacob arose and he lifted his sons and his wives onto the camels.
31:18	And he conveyed all of his kine and all of the substance that he had gotten, the acquisition [maidservants, etc.] of his accession [the flocks (see 30:43)], which he had acquired in Padan Aram, to come to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.
31:19	And Lavan had gone to shear his sheep [a three days distance (see 30:26)], and Rachel stole her father's teraphim [to break him of idolatry].
31:20	And Jacob stole the heart of Lavan the Aramite, not telling him that he fled.
31:21	And he fled, he and all that was with him, and he arose and crossed over the river, and he set his face towards Mount Gilead.
31:22	And it was told to Lavan on the third day that Jacob had fled.
31:23	And he took his brethren with him and pursued him, [covering] a distance of seven days [in one day], and he overtook him in Mount Gilead.
31:24	And G d came to Lavan the Aramite in a dream by night and He said to him: Take heed lest you speak with Jacob from good to evil. ["All the good of the wicked is evil to the righteous."]
31:25	And Lavan overtook Jacob. And Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain. And Lavan pitched (his tent) with his brethren in Mount Gilead.
31:26	And Lavan said to Jacob: What have you done, that you have stolen my heart and led away my daughters like captives of the sword?
31:27	Why did you flee in secret, stealing ["my mind"] from me and not telling me? I would have sent you away with joy and song, with timbrel and lyre.
31:28	And you did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters. You have now done foolishly.
31:29	I have the power to do evil with you, but the G d of your father said to me last night: Take care not to speak to Jacob from good to ill.
31:30	And now, though you be gone, for you longed for your father's house, why have you stolen my gods?
31:31	And Jacob answered and he said to Lavan [(answering first things first)]: For I was afraid. For I said: Lest you steal your daughters from me.
31:32	With whomever you find your gods, let him not live [(for which reason Rachel died on the road)]. Before our kinsmen, point out what is with me [that is yours], and take it for yourself. And Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.
31:33	And Lavan came into Jacob's [i.e., Rachel's] tent and into the tent of Leah and into the tent of the two handmaids, but he found nothing. And (when) he went out of the tent of Leah, he came [again] into the tent of Rachel, [knowing her to be a "toucher"].
31:34	And Rachel had taken the teraphim, and she had placed them on the camel's saddle-pillow and sat upon them. And Lavan "felt out" the whole tent and could not find them.
31:35	And she said to her father: Let it not anger my lord that I cannot rise before you, for I am in the way of women. And he searched, and he could not find the teraphim.
31:36	And Jacob was wroth and he strove with Lavan. And Jacob retorted and said to Lavan: What is my offense and what is my sin that you have pursued me?
31:37	For you have "felt out" all my articles. What have you found of all your household articles? Put it here before my brethren and yours, and let them judge between us.
31:38	This twenty years have I been with you. Your ewes and your she-goats have not miscarried, and the rams [(even a one-year-old being called a "ram")] of your flock I have not eaten.
31:39	An animal that was torn [by lion or wolf] I did not bring to you. I bore its loss; from my hand did you require it. Whether stolen by day or by night, [I paid for it].
31:40	In the day I was consumed by heat and in the night by frost, and sleep departed from my eyes.
31:41	This twenty years have I served you in your house — fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks; and you changed [the conditions of] my hire ten tens [i.e., a hundred times].
31:42	Had not the G d of my father, the G d of Abraham and the Dread of Yitzchak been with me, you would now have sent me away empty. G d saw my affliction and the toil of my hands and He reproved (you) last night.
31:43	And Lavan answered and he said to Jacob: The daughters are my daughters, and the sons are my sons, and the flocks are my flocks, and everything you see is mine. And, as for my daughters, what can I do to these today or to their children that they shall bear [i.e., How can it enter my mind to harm them?]
31:44	And now, come, let us make a covenant, I and you, and let Him be a witness between me and you.
31:45	And Jacob took a stone and he set it up as a monument.
31:46	And Jacob said to his brethren [i.e., his sons]: Gather stones. And they took stones and made a heap. And they ate there on the heap.
31:47	And Lavan called it Yegar Sahadutha ("the heap of testimony"), and Jacob called it Gal Ed [(the same)].
31:48	And Lavan said: This heap is testimony between me and you this day — wherefore its name is called Gal Ed.
31:49	And (it is also called) Mitzpah, [one of them] having said [to the other]: May the L rd see [yitzef] between me and you when one of us is absent from the other.
31:50	If you afflict my daughters [by withholding their conjugal times] and if you take wives in addition to my daughters [(Bilhah and Zilpah, too, were his daughters by a concubine)], no man being with us, see, G d is a witness between me and you.
31:51	And Lavan said to Jacob: Behold this heap and behold this monument which I have set up between me and you.
31:52	This heap is testimony and the monument is testimony that I will not cross this heap to you and you will not cross to me this heap and this monument for ill. [(You may not cross it for ill, but you may cross it for trade.)]
31:53	The G d of Abraham and the god of Nachor judge between us, the god of their father [Terach]. And Jacob swore by the Dread of his father, Isaac.
31:54	And Jacob slaughtered a slaughtering in the mountain and he called his brethren [his close friends who were with Lavan] to partake of the meal, and they partook of the meal and spent the night in the mountain.
32
32:1	And Lavan arose early in the morning and he kissed his sons and his daughters and he blessed them and he went, and Lavan returned to his place.
32:2	And Jacob went on his way, and angels of G d [from Eretz Yisrael] met him [to accompany him to Eretz Yisrael].
32:3	And Jacob said when he saw them: "This is a camp of G d," and he called the place Machanayim [lit., "two camps," those (angels) from outside Eretz Yisrael, who accompanied him until there, and those from Eretz Israel, who came to meet him].
Vayishlach
32:4	And Jacob sent angels before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.
32:5	And he charged them, saying: Thus shall you say to my lord, to Esau: Thus said your servant Jacob: With Lavan did I sojourn [(You need not hate me for the blessing of mastery over my brothers (27:29), it not having been fulfilled in me; I was merely a sojourner)], and I delayed until now.
32:6	And I had [only] ox and ass, flock and manservant and maidservant, [but not "of the dew of the heavens and the fats of the earth" promised me by our father (27:28)], and I have sent to tell my lord to find favor in your eyes [as a seeker of your love].
32:7	And the angels returned to Jacob, saying: We came to [the one you called] your brother, [but found that we had come] to Esau [the wicked one], and he is also coming out against you, and four hundred men with him.
32:8	And Jacob feared greatly [that he might be killed], and he was distressed [that he might kill others], and he divided the people that were with him and the flocks and the cattle and the camels into two camps.
32:9	And he said: If Esau comes to the one camp and smites it [in battle], then the remaining camp will escape, [(Jacob taking three defensive measures: gift (21), prayer (9), preparation for war (above)].
32:10	And Jacob said: The G d of my father Abraham and the G d of my father Isaac, [who under this appellation (28:13), promised to abet me (Ibid. 15)], the L rd, who said to me [under that appellation (32:3)]: Return to your land and to your birthplace and I shall do good with you —
32:11	I have become small [i.e., my merits have diminished] because of all of the lovingkindnesses and all of the truth [the fulfillment of all Your assurances] that You have done with Your servant. For with my staff did I cross this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.
32:12	Deliver me, I pray You, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau [i.e., from him who deports himself to me not as my brother, but as the wicked Esau.] For I fear him, lest he come and smite me, mother with children.
32:13	And You said: (I shall do) good [in your merit], I shall do good [in your fathers' merits] with you, and I shall make your seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be counted for multitude [see 28:15 and 22:17].
32:14	And he slept there that night, and he took from what he possessed a present for Esau his brother.
32:15	Two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, [the requisite number of mates], two hundred ewes and twenty rams.
32:16	Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten he-asses.
32:17	And he gave them into the hands of his servants, each herd [of each kind] by itself. And he said to his servants: Pass by before me [about a day's journey or less], and make a space [as far as the eye can see] between herd and herd [to impress Esau with the bounty].
32:18	And he charged the first, saying: If Esau my brother meets you and asks you: To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and for whom are these before you?
32:19	Then you shall say, [answering first things first, and last, last]: [We belong] to our servant Jacob, [and these before us are] a present sent to my lord, Esau, and, behold, he [Jacob], too, is behind us.
32:20	And he charged the second, also the third, also all who went behind the flocks, saying: Thus shall you speak to Esau when you find him.
32:21	And you shall say also: Behold, your servant Jacob is behind us. For he said: I will remove his anger with the gift that goes before me, and then I will see his face. Perhaps he will be accepting of me.
32:22	And the present passed before him, and he slept that night in the camp.
32:23	And he arose that night and took his wives and his two handmaids, and his eleven children [(having secreted Dinah in a chest so that Esau not take her)], and he crossed the ford of Yabbok.
32:24	And he took them and passed them over the stream, and he passed over what was his, [the beasts and the chattel].
32:25	And Jacob remained alone, [having returned for some small jars], and a man [Esau's guardian angel] wrestled with him until the rising of the morning star.
32:26	And he saw that he could not prevail over him, and he touched the hollow [the upper bone] of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh tore loose as he wrestled with him.
32:27	And he said: Release me, for the morning star has risen, [and I must intone song (to G d) in the daytime.] And he said: I will not release you until you bless me [i.e., until you acquiesce in my father's blessings to me and cease contesting them.]
32:28	And he said to him: What is your name? And he said: Jacob.
32:29	And he said: Your name shall no longer be called Jacob [connoting gaining of the blessings by deception (akvah)], but Yisrael; for you have contended (saritha) with elohim (the angel of Esau) and with men [Esau and Lavan] and you have prevailed.
32:30	And Jacob asked: "Tell me, I pray you, your name." And he said: "Why do you ask my name?" [(the names of the angels changing according to their deputation)], and he (the angel) blessed him there.
32:31	And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel. For I saw elohim face to face (panim el panim), and my soul was spared.
32:32	And the dawn broke for him when he crossed Penuel, and he was limping on his thigh.
32:33	Therefore, the children of Israel do not eat the "slipping tendon" on the hollow of the thigh until this day. For he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh on the slipping tendon.
33
33:1	And Jacob lifted his eyes and he saw, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men; and he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two handmaids.
33:2	And he placed the handmaids and their children first, and Leah and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph behind, [the most beloved hindmost].
33:3	And he passed before them, [placing himself first for the contingency of war], and he bowed down to the earth seven times until he came near to his brother.
33:4	And Esau ran towards him and embraced him, and he fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.
33:5	And he lifted his eyes and he saw the women and the children, and he said: "What are these to you?" And he said: The children that G d granted to your servant.
33:6	And the handmaids drew near, they and their children, and they prostrated themselves.
33:7	And Leah and her children also drew near and they prostrated themselves. And afterwards Joseph and Rachel drew near [(Joseph before Rachel, as opposed to the others, where the women went first, Joseph desiring to shield Rachel (who was very beautiful) from the gaze of Esau)], and they prostrated themselves.
33:8	And he said: Who is all this camp of yours [the bearers of the gifts] that I have met? And he said: To find favor in the eyes of my lord.
33:9	And Esau said: I have much [more than I need], my brother; let there be yours what is yours, [Esau acknowledging the blessing as Jacob's due].
33:10	And Jacob said: Do not [speak thus], I pray you. If I have found favor in your eyes, take my gift from my hand. For it is fitting [that you do so], (for) I have seen your face, and [this is as grand in my eyes] as having seen the face of an angel [(the guardian angel of Esau, 32:24)]; and [it is also fitting that you accept my gift] because you have been conciliated by me.
33:11	Take my [greeting-] gift, I pray you, which has been brought to you [without any exertion on your part], for the L rd has been gracious to me, and I have all [that I need]. And he pressed him, and he took it.
33:12	And he said: Travel on and go, and I will go along with you.
33:13	And he said to him: My lord knows that the children are frail, and the flocks and herds, which are tending their young, are upon me [to move them slowly], and if they are overdriven one day, then all of the sheep will die.
33:14	Let my lord, I pray you, pass before his servant, and I will lead on slowly, according to the work incumbent upon me, and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir [(Jacob intending to go only as far as Succoth, letting Esau wait in Seir if he intended him any harm.)]
33:15	And Esau said: Let me now leave with you some of the people that are with me. And he said: Why [do] this? Let me [but] find favor in the eyes of my lord, [with no other recompense].
33:16	And Esau [alone] returned on that day on his way to Seir, [having been abandoned by the four hundred men who were with him.]
33:17	And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and he built himself a house; and for his kine he made booths (succoth), wherefore the place was called Succoth.
33:18	And Jacob came complete to the city of Shchem in the land of Canaan [complete in his body (having recovered from his limp), complete in his wealth, complete in his Torah], when he came from Padan Aram, [having emerged unscathed from his encounters with Lavan and Esau], and he encamped before the city.
33:19	And he bought the part of the field where he had pitched his tent from the sons of Chamor the father of Shchem for a hundred kesitah.
33:20	And he erected an altar there, and he called it "The Almighty is the G d of Israel" (i.e., Jacob.)
34
34:1	And Dinah the daughter of Leah ["Like mother, like daughter" — Leah also "went out" (30:16)], whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
34:2	And Shchem the son of Chamor, the Chivi, the prince of the land, saw her, and he took her and he lay with her [naturally], and he afflicted her [unnaturally].
34:3	And his soul cleaved to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the maiden and he spoke to the heart of the maiden [by suasion].
34:4	And Shchem said to Chamor, his father: Take this girl for me as a wife.
34:5	And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter, and his sons were with his herds in the field, and Jacob remained silent until they came.
34:6	And Chamor the father of Shchem went out to Jacob to speak to him.
34:7	And the sons of Jacob came from the field when they heard, and the men were saddened and greatly angered, for he had done a shameful thing in Israel to lie with the daughter of Jacob, and such [(to afflict virgins)] was not to be done, [the nations having "fenced themselves" against illicit relations after the flood].
34:8	And Chamor spoke with them, saying: My son, Shchem, desired your daughter. Give her to him, I pray you, as a wife.
34:9	And intermarry with us. Give us your daughters [as you choose], and our daughters take for yourselves [as you choose].
34:10	And dwell with us and the land shall be before you. Sit and trade in it, and gain a holding in it.
34:11	And Shchem said to her father and to her brothers: Let me find favor in your eyes, and what you tell me shall I give.
34:12	Heap upon me much dowry and gift, and I will give it, as you tell me, but give me the maiden as a wife.
34:13	And the sons of Jacob answered Shchem and Chamor his father with subtlety, and they spoke [thus rightfully], for he had defiled Dinah their sister.
34:14	And they said to them: We shall not be able to do this thing, to give our sister to a man with a foreskin, for it is an abomination to us.
34:15	Only with this will we consent to you, if you will be like us — to have all your males circumcised.
34:16	Then we will give our daughters to you [as we choose], and your daughters [i.e., those we choose] shall we take for ourselves. And we will dwell with you and we will be one people.
34:17	And if you do not heed us to circumcise yourselves, then we will take our daughter and go.
34:18	And their words were good in the eyes of Chamor and in the eyes of Shchem the son of Chamor.
34:19	And the young man did not delay doing the thing, for he desired the daughter of Jacob, and he was the most highly honored in his father's house.
34:20	And Chamor and Shchem his son came to the gate of their city and they spoke to the men of their city, saying:
34:21	These men are whole-hearted with us. Let them dwell in the land and trade in it; the land is "broad-handed" [i.e., ample] before them [You will lose nothing by their presence.] Their daughters shall we take for ourselves as wives [by our choice], and our daughters shall we give to them [by our choice].
34:22	Only with this will the men consent to dwell with us, to be one people, by all of our males being circumcised as they are circumcised.
34:23	Their herds, their possessions, and all of their beasts — are they not ours? Let us but consent to them [to be circumcised], and they will dwell with us.
34:24	And they hearkened to Chamor and to Shchem his son, all that went out of the gate of his city, and all the males were circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
34:25	And it was on the third day, when they were in pain, that two of Jacob's sons [(Though they were Jacob's sons, they did not consult him)], Shimon and Levi, the brothers of Dinah, [risking their lives for her], took each man his sword, and came upon the city secure, [in that the men were ailing], and they killed every male.
34:26	And Chamor and Shchem his son they slew by the sword, and they took Dinah from the house of Shchem and they went out.
34:27	The sons of Jacob came upon the slain [to strip them], and they despoiled the city that had defiled their sister.
34:28	Their sheep, their cattle, and their asses, and what was in the city and what was in the field they took.
34:29	And all of their possessions, and all of their little ones, and their wives, they took captive and they plundered, and all that was in the house.
34:30	And Jacob said to Shimon and to Levi: You have sullied me, to make me odious with the inhabitant of the land, the Canaani and Perizi. And I am but few in number, and they will gather against me and smite me, and I will be destroyed, I and my house.
34:31	And they said: Shall they make our sister as an abandoned one!
35
35:1	And G d said to Jacob: Arise, and go up to Bethel, [(You have been punished through your daughter for having tarried upon the way)], and abide there, and make there an altar to the G d who appeared to you when you fled from Esau your brother.
35:2	And Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him: Remove the strange gods that are with you [from the spoil of Shchem] and cleanse yourselves [of idolatry], and change your garments, [lest you have a vestment devoted to idolatry].
35:3	And let us arise and go up to Bethel, and I will make an altar there to the G d who answered me in the day of my affliction and who was with me in the way in which I went.
35:4	And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hands and the rings which were in their ears, and Jacob buried them under the terebinth near Shchem.
35:5	And they journeyed, and the terror of G d was on the cities around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.
35:6	And Jacob came to Luz in the land of Canaan (the same as Bethel), he and all the people that were with him.
35:7	And he built an altar there, and he called the place "The Almighty is in Bethel"; for G d had revealed Himself to him there when he fled from his brother.
35:8	And Devorah, Rivkah's nurse, [(whom Rivkah had sent to Padan Aram to tell Jacob to return)], died. And she was buried beneath Bethel, [i.e., at the foot of the mountain on which Bethel was built], on the slope terrace; and he called its name Alon Bachuth ("the plain of weeping").
35:9	And G d appeared to Jacob again, [a second time in this place (once in his going; the other, in his returning)] when he came from Padan Aram, and He blessed him [(the mourners' blessing)].
35:10	And G d said to him: Your name — Jacob — your name shall no longer be called "Jacob" [connoting deviousness], but "Yisrael" [connoting lordship] shall be your name; and He called his name Yisrael.
35:11	And He said to him: I am the G d Shaddai [It becomes Me (ani kedai) to bless, all blessings being Mine]: Be fruitful and multiply [(Benjamin had not yet been born)]. A nation [Benjamin] and a congregation of nations [Menasheh and Ephraim] shall come forth from you; and kings [Saul and Ish Bosheth (of the tribe of Benjamin)] shall issue forth from your loins.
35:12	And the land that I gave to Abraham and to Isaac, to you will I give it, and to your seed after you will I give the land.
35:13	And G d ascended from (over) him in the place where He spoke with him.
35:14	And Jacob set up a monument in the place where He spoke with him, a monument of stone, and he poured a libation thereon, and he poured oil thereon.
35:15	And Jacob called the name of the place where G d spoke with him Bethel.
35:16	And they traveled from Bethel, and there was yet a kivrah of land to come to Efrath, when Rachel gave birth, travailing in labor.
35:17	And it was, as she travailed in labor, that the midwife said to her: Do not fear, for this, too [in addition to Joseph], is a son for you.
35:18	And it was, as her soul departed in death, that she called his name Ben Oni ["son of my travail"]; and his father called him Binyamin ["son of the south," (Canaan, where he was born, being south of Aram Naharayim, whence Jacob had come)].
35:19	And Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Efrath, which is Bethlehem.
35:20	And Jacob set a monument upon her grave, the monument of Rachel's grave until this day.
35:21	And Israel journeyed and he pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder.
35:22	And it was, when Israel dwelt in that land, [delaying coming to his father Isaac in Chevron], that Reuven went and lay with Bilhah, his father's concubine, and Israel heard; and the sons of Jacob [after the birth of Benjamin] were twelve [the full complement of the tribes].
35:23	The sons of Leah: the first-born of Jacob, Reuven [first-born in respect to inheritance, Divine service, and numeration (of the tribes)], Shimon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and Zevulun.
35:24	The sons of Rachel, Joseph and Benjamin.
35:25	And the sons of Bilhah, the handmaid of Rachel, Dan and Naftali.
35:26	And the sons of Zilpah, the handmaid of Leah, Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Padan Aram.
35:27	And Jacob came to Isaac his father, to [the plain of] Mamre, [to the city of] Kiryath Ha'Arba, which is Chevron, where Abraham and Isaac lived.
35:28	And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years.
35:29	And Isaac expired and he died, and he was gathered to his people, old and sated with days. And Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.
36
36:1	And these are the progeny of Esau, who is Edom:
36:2	Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah, the daughter of Elon the Chitti [same as Basmath (26:34)] and Ahalivamah [same as Yehudith (Ibid.)], the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Tzivon, the Chivi [i.e., the daughter of Tzivon by the wife of his son Anah (see 36:24)].
36:3	And Basmath the daughter of Ishmael [same as Machlath (38:9)], the sister of Nevayoth, [thus referred to here because Nevayoth gave her in marriage after Ishmael's death].
36:4	And Adah bore to Esau, Elifaz; and Basmath bore Reuel.
36:5	And Ahalivamah bore Yeush and Ya'alam and Korach. These are the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
36:6	And Esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters and all the souls of his house, and his herds and all of his beasts, and all of his possessions which he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and he went to a land [i.e., to live wherever he could find room] away from Jacob his brother.
36:7	For their possessions were too great to (allow them to) remain together, and the land of their sojourning could not contain them because of [the pasture land required for] their cattle.
36:8	And Esau dwelt in Mount Seir. Esau is Edom.
36:9	And these are the generations of Esau the father of Edom, [which his sons begot] in [i.e., after he went to] the mountain of Seir.
36:10	These are the names of the sons of Esau: Elifaz, the son of Adah, the wife of Esau; Reuel, the son of Basmath, the wife of Esau.
36:11	And the sons of Elifaz were Teman, Omar, Tz'fo, Ga'atam, and Kenaz.
36:12	And Timna was concubine to Elifaz the son of Esau, and she bore to Elifaz, Amalek. These are the sons of Adah, the wife of Esau.
36:13	And these are the sons of Reuel: Nachath and Zerach, Shammah and Mizzah. These were the sons of Basmath, the wife of Esau.
36:14	And these were the sons of Ahalivamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Tzivon, the wife of Esau. She bore to Esau Yeush and Ya'alam and Korach.
36:15	These are the chiefs [i.e., the heads of families] of the sons of Esau. The sons of Elifaz, the first-born of Esau: Chief Teman, Chief Omar, Chief Tzefo, Chief Kenaz.
36:16	Chief Korach, Chief Ga'atam, Chief Amalek. These are the chiefs of Elifaz in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Adah.
36:17	And these are the sons of Reuel the son of Esau: Chief Nachath, Chief Zerach, Chief Shammah, Chief Mizzah. These are the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Basmath, the wife of Esau.
36:18	And these are the sons of Ahalivamah the wife of Esau: Chief Yeush, Chief Ya'alam, Chief Korach. These are the chiefs of Ahalivamah the daughter of Anah the wife of Esau.
36:19	These are the sons of Esau, and these are their chiefs. He is Edom.
36:20	These are the sons of Seir the Chori, the inhabitants of the land [before Esau came there]: Lotan, Shoval, Tzivon, and Anah.
36:21	And Dishon and Etzer and Dishan. These are the chiefs of the Chori, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom.
36:22	And the sons of Lotan were Chori and Hemam, and the sister of Lotan [by his mother, but not by his father, Seir (20)] was Timna.
36:23	And these are the sons of Shoval: Alvan and Manachath and Eval, Shefo and Onam.
36:24	And these are the sons of Tzivon: Ayah and Anah. This is the Anah [mentioned above (20) as the brother of Tzivon (Tzivon lived with his mother and begot Anah)], who "found" the yemim [(lit., "fearful ones," white mules, whose kick is dreaded)], in the desert when he grazed [i.e., mated] the asses belonging to Tzivon his father [with horses. (Being a bastard, he gendered bastards.)]
36:25	And these are the children of Anah: Dishon and Ahalivamah the daughter of Anah.
36:26	And these are the sons of Dishan: Chemdan, Eshban, Yithran, and Ch'ran.
36:27	These are the sons of Etzer: Bilhan, Za'avan, and Akkan.
36:28	These are the sons of Dishan: Utz and Aran.
36:29	These are the chiefs of the Chori: Chief Lotan, Chief Shoval, Chief Tzivon, Chief Anah.
36:30	Chief Dishon, Chief Etzer, Chief Dishan. These are the chiefs of the Chori according to their chiefs in the land of Seir.
36:31	And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom before a king reigned over the children of Israel.
36:32	And there reigned in Edom Bela the son of Be'or; and the name of his city was Dinhavah.
36:33	And Bala died, and there reigned in his stead Yovav the son of Zerach from Batzrah [a Moavite city].
36:34	And Yovav died, and there reigned in his stead Chisham from the land of the Temani.
36:35	And Chusham died, and there reigned in his stead Haddad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moav, [Edom joining forces with Moav against Midian]. And the name of his city was Avith.
36:36	And Haddad died, and there reigned in his stead Samlah from Masrekah.
36:37	And Samlah died, and there reigned in his stead Shaul from Rechovoth Hanahar.
36:38	And Shaul died, and there reigned in his stead Bal Chanan the son of Achbor.
36:39	And Bal Chanan the son of Achbor died, and there reigned in his stead Haddad. And the name of his city was Pau; and the name of his wife was Mehetavel the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mei Zahav [= mahu zahav — "Of what value is gold?" (gold being of no significance to him in the enormity of his wealth)].
36:40	And these are the names of the chiefs of Esau, according to their families, after their places by their [the places'] names [the kingship having ended with Haddad]: the chief of Timna, the chief of Avlah, the chief of Yetheth.
36:41	Chief Ahalivamah, Chief Elah, Chief Pinon.
36:42	Chief Kenaz, Chief Teman, Chief Mivtzar.
36:43	Chief Magdiel [Rome], Chief Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom by their habitations in the land of their holding. This is Esau the father of Edom.

37:1	And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan.
37:2	[And] these [(following the abbreviated chronicles of Esau)] are the [habitations and wanderings of the] generations of Jacob [until they came to a permanent settlement]: Joseph, when he was seventeen years old, grazed the flock with his brothers. And he was a lad [He would do callow things, preening and primping himself], (associating) with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, the wives of his father. [His brothers scorned them, and he befriended them.] And Joseph brought evil report of them [the sons of Leah] to their father.
37:3	And Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, for he was the son of his old age. And he made him a robe of fine wool.
37:4	And his brothers saw that his father loved him more than all his brothers, and they [being "one in mouth and one in heart"] could not speak peaceably to him.
37:5	And Joseph dreamed a dream and he told (the dream) to his brothers, and they hated him even more.
37:6	And he said to them: Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed.
37:7	And, behold, we were binding sheaves in the midst of the field, and, behold, my sheaf arose and remained standing, and behold, your sheaves surrounded it and bowed down to my sheaf.
37:8	And his brothers said to him: Will you reign over us? Will you rule over us? And they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words [the evil report (2)].
37:9	And he dreamed another dream, and he told it to his brothers, and he said: Behold, I have dreamed another dream, and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowing down to me.
37:10	And he told it to his father and to his brothers [together, after having told it to his brothers]. And his father rebuked him [for arousing hatred to himself] and he said to him: What is this dream which you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers come to bow down to you to the earth? [i.e., How can this be if your mother is dead! (Jacob not knowing that it would be fulfilled through Bilhah, who had reared Joseph as a mother.)]
37:11	And his brothers envied him, and his father awaited the [materialization of] the thing.
37:12	And his brothers went to graze their father's flock in Shchem.
37:13	And Israel said to Joseph: Are your brothers not grazing in Shchem? Go, and I will send you to them. And he said to him: I am here [at your service (though knowing that his brothers hated him)].
37:14	And he said to him: Go now, and see how your brothers fare and how the flock fares, and return word to me. And he sent him from [i.e., towards realization of] the deep [counsel of the one (Abraham) buried in] Chevron, [viz. (15:13): "For your seed shall be a stranger, etc."], and he came to Shchem.
37:15	And a man [the angel Gabriel] found him, and, behold, he was straying in the field. And the man asked him: What are you seeking?
37:16	And he said: I am seeking my brothers; tell me, I pray you, where they are grazing.
37:17	And the man said: They have departed from this [i.e., from brotherhood]. For I heard them saying: Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brothers, and he found them in Dothan.
37:18	And they saw him from afar. And before he approached them they schemed against him to put him to death.
37:19	And each said to the other: Behold, this dreamer of dreams is coming.
37:20	And now, let us go to slay him, and let us cast him in one of the pits. And we will say: An evil beast devoured him, and [(the Holy Spirit thus saying)]: We will see what will be his dreams [i.e., whether your words will be fulfilled or Mine].
37:21	And Reuven heard and he rescued him from their hand, saying: Let us not strike him a death blow.
37:22	And Reuven said to them: Do not spill blood. Cast him into this pit, which is in the desert, but do not send a hand against him, [Reuven saying this (thus the testimony of the Holy Spirit)] in order to rescue him from their hands, to return him to his father.
37:23	And it was, when Joseph came to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his robe, the robe of fine wool that was upon him.
37:24	And they took him and cast him into a pit, and the pit was empty; there was no water in it, [but there were snakes and scorpions in it.]
37:25	And they sat down to eat bread, and they lifted their eyes and they saw, and, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, and their camels laden with spicery, balm, and laudanum [(rather than the usual foul-smelling load — providentially, for Joseph's benefit)], going to take it down to Egypt.
37:26	And Judah said to his brothers: What [monetary] profit if we kill our brother and conceal his death?
37:27	Let us go and sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let our hand not be against him, for he is our brother, our flesh; and his brothers acquiesced.
37:28	And Midianite merchants passed by; and they [Joseph's brothers] pulled and raised Joseph out of the pit, and they sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver [and the Ishmaelites sold him to the Midianites] and they brought Joseph to Egypt.
37:29	And Reuven returned to the pit, [it having been his day to pay attendance upon his father], and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit, and he rent his garments.
37:30	And he returned to his brothers and he said: The youth is not here, and I, where shall I come? [i.e., Whither shall I flee from my father's grief?]
37:31	And they took Joseph's robe, and they slaughtered a kid of goats, [whose blood is similar to a man's], and they dipped the robe in the blood.
37:32	And they sent the robe of fine wool and they brought it to their father. And they said: This we found. Recognize, now, whether or not it is your son's robe.
37:33	And he recognized it, and he said: The robe of my son. A wild beast has devoured him; Joseph has been torn.
37:34	And Jacob rent his garments and placed sackcloth on his loins, and he mourned his son many days [twenty-two years].
37:35	And all his sons and all his daughters arose to console him [(one view: a twin girl was born with each son, and each married a step-sister. Another view: "daughters" here are daughters-in-law)]. And he refused to be consoled, [consolation not "taking" for a living person who is thought dead.] And he said: For I will go down to the grave mourning over my son. And his father [Isaac] bewept him [Jacob (for his grieving)].
37:36	And the Medanites sold him to Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, head of the slaughterers.
38
38:1	And it was at that time that Judah was brought down [from his greatness] by his brothers [(When they beheld their father's grief, they said to him: You told us to sell him; if you had told us to return him, we would have heeded you)], and he turned [away from his brothers] to [partnership with] an Adulamite man by the name of Chirah.
38:2	And Judah saw there the daughter of a merchant by the name of Shua. And he took her and lived with her.
38:3	And she conceived and she bore a son and he called his name Er.
38:4	And she conceived again and she bore a son and she called his name Onan.
38:5	And she again bore a son and she called him Shelah. And he was in Keziv ["cessation" (from bearing)] when she bore him.
38:6	And Judah took a wife for Er, his first-born, whose name was Tamar.
38:7	And Er, the first-born of Judah, was evil in the eyes of the L rd, [destroying his seed to preserve his wife's beauty], and the L rd killed him.
38:8	And Judah said to Onan: Come to your brother's wife and take her in levirate marriage, and establish seed for your brother, [the son being called by the latter's name].
38:9	And Onan knew that not his would be the seed. And it was, when he came to his brother's wife, that he destroyed [the seed] to the ground ["threshing within and winnowing without"], not to give seed to his brother.
38:10	And it was evil in the eyes of the L rd what he had done, and He killed him too.
38:11	And Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law [as a pretext for not giving Shelah to her]: Remain a widow in your father's house until Shelah my son grows up. For he said (to himself): Lest he, too, die as his brothers. And Tamar went and she sat in her father's house.
38:12	And in the course of time, the daughter of Shua, Judah's wife, died. And Judah was consoled and he went up to [supervise] his sheep shearers, he and Chirah his companion, the Adulamite, to Timnah.
38:13	And it was told to Tamar, saying: Behold, your father-in-law has gone up to Timnah to shear his sheep.
38:14	And she removed her widow's weeds, and she donned a veil and covered her face, and she sat at the crossroads on the way to Timnah. For she saw that Shelah had grown and that she had not been given to him as a wife. [(And Tamar was desirous of perpetuating Judah's line)]
38:15	And Judah saw her and he thought her to be a harlot, [for she sat at the crossroads], for she had covered her face [that he not be able to recognize her].
38:16	And he detoured to her to the way [on which she sat]. And he said: Ready yourself that I may come to you. (For he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law.) And she said to him: What will you give me for coming to me?
38:17	And he said: I shall send a goat-kid from the flock. And she said: If you give me a pledge until you send it.
38:18	And he said: What is the pledge that I shall give you? And she said: Your signet and your cloak and the staff that is in your hand. And he gave it to her and he came to her and she conceived to him [i.e., strong ones like him: righteous ones like him].
38:19	And she arose, and she went, and she removed her veil from her, and she donned her widow's garments.
38:20	And Judah sent the goat-kid with his friend the Adulamite to take the pledge from the woman, and he did not find her.
38:21	And he asked the men of her place: Where is the harlot of the crossroads? And they said: There was no harlot here.
38:22	And he returned to Judah and he said: I did not find her, and the men of the place also said: There was no harlot here.
38:23	And Judah said: Let her take it [what she had], lest we be put to shame [i.e., exposed by our oversolicitous inquiry]. Behold, I sent this kid and you did not find her. [What more could I have done?]
38:24	And it was, with the tripling of the months [the greater part of the first, the greater part of the last, and all of the middle] that it was told to Judah: Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot, and she is also pregnant by harlotry. And Judah said: Take her out and let her be burned, [Tamar being the daughter of Shem, a Cohein (see Rashi on 14:18 and Leviticus 21:9)].
38:25	As she was being taken out [to be burned], she sent to her father-in-law, saying, I am with child by the man to whom these belong. And she said: Recognize, I pray you, whose are this signet and cloak and staff.
38:26	And Judah recognized them and he said: She is right. [She is with child] by me. For [she acted] justly [in that] I did not give her to Shelah my son. And he did not live with her again.
38:27	And it was, at the time of her bearing, that, behold, there were twins in her womb.
38:28	And it was, as she bore, that one put forth his hand. And the midwife took and tied a red string on his hand, saying: This one came out first.
38:29	And it was, when he drew back his hand, that his brother came out. And she said: How you have girded yourself with strength [paretz]! And he called his name Paretz.
38:30	And then his brother came out on whose hand was the [shining] red string. And he called his name Zarach ["shining"].
39
39:1	And Joseph [before the aforementioned episode] had been brought down to Egypt. And he was bought [as a slave] by Potiphar, Pharaoh's officer, the head of the slaughterers, an Egyptian man, from the hand of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down there.
39:2	And the L rd was with Joseph, and he was a successful man, and he remained in the house of his lord, the Egyptian.
39:3	And his master saw that the L rd was with him [(The name of the L rd was ever in his mouth)] and that whatever he did the L rd prospered in his hand.
39:4	And Joseph found favor in his eyes, and he served him; and he appointed him over his house, and all that he had he placed in his hand.
39:5	And it was, from the time he appointed him over his household and over all that he had, that the L rd blessed the house of the Egyptian for the sake of Joseph; and the L rd's blessing was over all that he had, in the house and in the field.
39:6	And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand, and he paid no heed to anything with him but "the bread that he ate" [i.e., his wife]. And Joseph was beautiful in form and appearance, [eating well, and primping and preening himself].
39:7	And it was [immediately] after these things that his master's wife lifted her eyes to Joseph and said: "Lie with me."
39:8	And he refused. And he said to his master's wife: Behold, my lord does not know what is with me in the house, and all that he has he has placed in my hand.
39:9	There is no one greater in this house than I, and he has withheld nothing from me but you, in that you are his wife. And how can I do this great evil and sin against G d? [illicit relations being forbidden to the Noachides].
39:10	And it was, as she spoke to Joseph day after day, and he did not heed her to lie with her [even without intercourse] to be with her [(in Gehinnom) in the world to come],
39:11	it happened, on a certain [festival] day [when all had gone to the house of idolatry], when he came to the house to do his work, and none of the men of the household were there in the house,
39:12	that she grabbed him by his garment, saying: "Lie with me!" And he left his garment in her hand and he fled and ran outside.
39:13	And it was, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had run outside,
39:14	that she called to the men of her house and said to them: See, he [i.e., her husband] brought to us an Ivri [from ever hanahar, the other side of the river (Euphrates), of the sons of Ever] to disport himself with us [i.e., me]. He came to me to lie with me and I made great outcry.
39:15	And it was, when he heard me lifting my voice and calling out, that he left his garment with me, and he fled and ran outside.
39:16	And she left his garment with her until his lord came to his house.
39:17	And she spoke to him such things, saying: The Ivri slave that you brought to us came to me to disport himself with me.
39:18	And it was, when I raised my voice and called out, that he left his garment with me and fled outside.
39:19	And it was, when his master heard [during intercourse] the words of his wife, who spoke to him, saying: Such [(intimate) things] did your slave do with me, that his wrath burned.
39:20	And Joseph's master took him and placed him in the prison house, the place where the king's prisoners were incarcerated; and he remained there in the prison house.
39:21	And the L rd was with Joseph, and He conferred grace upon him, and He granted him favor in the eyes of the overseer of the prison house.
39:22	And the overseer of the prison house placed all of the prisoners in the prison house in Joseph's charge; and all that was done there was done at his bidding.
39:23	The overseer of the prison house looked after nothing in his hand in that the L rd was with him, and whatever he did, the L rd prospered.
40
40:1	And it was, after these things, [(G d diverting talk against Joseph to talk against the king's stewards)] that the butler of the king of Egypt and the baker [of his bread] offended their lord, the king of Egypt [(a fly was found in the wine, and a pebble in the bread)].
40:2	And Pharaoh grew wroth with his two eunuchs, the chief butler and the chief baker.
40:3	And he placed them in custody in the house of the head of the slaughterers, in the prison house where Joseph was incarcerated.
40:4	And the head of the slaughterers charged Joseph [to be] with them, and he ministered to them, and they were days [twelve months] in ward.
40:5	And the two of them dreamed a dream, each his dream in one night, each according to the [eventual] materialization of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison house.
40:6	And Joseph came to them in the morning and he saw them, and they were distraught.
40:7	And he asked the eunuchs of Pharaoh who were in ward with him in his master's house: Why are your faces downcast today?
40:8	And they said to him: We dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them: Are not interpretations unto G d? Tell it, I pray you, to me.
40:9	And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, saying to him: In my dream, behold, a grapevine before me.
40:10	And on the grapevine, three shoots, which seemed to bud. And its blossom sprouted; and its clusters brought forth grapes.
40:11	And Pharaoh's goblet was in my hand. And I took the grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh's goblet; and I placed the goblet on Pharaoh's hand.
40:12	And Joseph said to him: This is its interpretation: The three shoots are three days.
40:13	In three more days, Pharaoh will count you [with his other attendants], and he will restore you to your post, and you will place the cup of Pharaoh in his hand as at first, when you would give him drink.
40:14	So that if you remember me with you when it is well with you, then do lovingkindness with me, I pray you, and mention me to Pharaoh, and take me out of this house.
40:15	For I have been stolen from the land of the Hebrews. And here, too, I did nothing that they should put me into the pit.
40:16	And the chief baker saw that he had interpreted well, and he said to Joseph: I, too, in my dream; and behold, three wicker baskets on my head.
40:17	And in the top basket, of all the food of Pharaoh, the work of a baker. And the birds ate them from the basket on my head.
40:18	And Joseph answered and he said: This is its interpretation: The three baskets are three days.
40:19	In another three days, Pharaoh will lift your head from you and hang you upon a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh from you.
40:20	And it was on the third day, Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants. And he counted the chief butler and the chief baker in the midst of his servants.
40:21	And he restored the chief butler (to officiate) over his drink, and he placed the goblet on Pharaoh's hand.
40:22	And the chief baker he hanged, as Joseph had interpreted for them.
40:23	And the chief butler did not remember Joseph [on that day], and he forgot him [afterwards].

41:1	And it was at the end of two years that Pharaoh dreamt. And, behold, he was standing by the Nile.
41:2	And, behold, from the Nile there came up seven kine of good appearance and fat flesh, and they fed in the reed grass.
41:3	And, behold, seven other kine came up after them from the Nile, of bad appearance and thin flesh. And they stood near the kine on the bank of the Nile.
41:4	And the seven kine of bad appearance and of thin flesh ate the seven kine of good appearance and of fat flesh [(signifying the forgetting of the years of plenty in the years of famine)], and Pharaoh awoke.
41:5	And he slept and he dreamed a second time, and, behold, seven ears of corn arose upon one stalk, healthy and good.
41:6	And, behold, seven ears of corn, thin, and beaten by the east wind sprouted after them.
41:7	And the seven thin ears swallowed up the seven healthy, full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a [completed] dream [demanding an interpretation].
41:8	And it was in the morning that his spirit was agitated, and he sent and called all the necromancers of Egypt and all its wise men; and Pharaoh told his dream to them, but none could interpret them to Pharaoh [i.e., to Pharaoh's satisfaction.]
41:9	And the chief butler spoke to Pharaoh, saying: I make mention of my faults this day.
41:10	Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and he placed me in custody in the house of the head of the slaughterers — me and the chief baker.
41:11	And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; each according to [i.e., in consonance with] the [subsequent] interpretation of his dream did we dream.
41:12	And there was with us a youth [a simpleton], an Ivri, [who does not even know our language], a slave [(unworthy of royal regard)] to the head of the slaughterers, and we told him and he interpreted our dreams; each according to [the nature of] his dream did he interpret.
41:13	And it was, [just] as he interpreted it to us did it come to pass. I, he [Pharaoh] restored to my post, and him he hanged.
41:14	And Pharaoh sent and called (for) Joseph, and they hastened him out of the pit, and he cut his hair [in deference to the king], and he changed his garments, and he came to Pharaoh.
41:15	And Pharaoh said to Joseph: I dreamed a dream and none can interpret it. And I have heard about you that you understand a dream to interpret it.
41:16	And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying: It [the interpretation of dreams] is not mine; G d will answer [through my mouth] for the peace of Pharaoh.
41:17	And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph: In my dream, behold, I was standing on the bank of the Nile.
41:18	And, behold, from the Nile there came up seven kine of fat flesh and good appearance, and they fed in the reed grass.
41:19	And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, lean, of very bad appearance and thin-fleshed. I never saw such in all the land of Egypt for badness.
41:20	And the thin, bad kine ate the first fat kine.
41:21	And they came into their midst, but it could not be known that they had come into their midst, for their appearance was bad as in the beginning — and I awoke.
41:22	And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears of corn came up on one stalk, full and good.
41:23	And, behold, seven ears of corn, parched thin, beaten by the east wind, sprouted after them.
41:24	And the thin ears swallowed the seven good ears. And I related this to the magicians, and none could tell me (what it meant).
41:25	And Joseph said to Pharaoh: The dream of Pharaoh is one. What G d is to do He has told to Pharaoh.
41:26	The seven good kine are seven years, and the seven good ears are [the same] seven years. It is one dream.
41:27	And the seven thin, bad kine that came up after them are seven years. And the seven thin ears beaten by the east wind will be seven years of famine.
41:28	This is the thing that I have spoken to Pharaoh. What G d is to do He has shown to Pharaoh.
41:29	Behold, seven years are coming — great plenty in all the land of Egypt.
41:30	And seven years of famine will arise after them, and all the plenty in the land of Egypt will be forgotten, [thus, the "swallowing" (24)], and the famine will consume the land.
41:31	And the plenty will not be known in the land because of that famine afterwards [thus, "And it was not noticeable, etc." (21)] because it will be very sore.
41:32	And as to the repeating of the dream to Pharaoh twice, it is because the thing is readied from G d, and G d is hastening to do it.
41:33	And now, let Pharaoh see (to find) an understanding, wise man, and let him place him over the land of Egypt.
41:34	Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers for the land, and let him spur on the (people of) the land of Egypt in the seven years of plenty.
41:35	And let them gather up all the food of these coming good years, and let them store up grain under the hand of Pharaoh, food in the cities, and let them guard it.
41:36	And the [stored-up] food will be a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which will prevail in the land of Egypt, and the land will not be cut off in the famine.
41:37	And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants.
41:38	And Pharaoh said to his servants: Can there be found such a one! a man invested with the spirit of G d.
41:39	And Pharaoh said to Joseph: Since G d has apprised you of all this, there is none so understanding and wise as you [(Pharaoh's response to 33)].
41:40	You will be over my house, and by your word shall all my people be fed. Only (in) the throne [i.e., the name of "king"] shall I be greater than you.
41:41	And Pharaoh said to Joseph: See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.
41:42	And Pharaoh removed his ring from his hand and placed it on Joseph's hand, [thus making him second to himself], and he robed him in vestments of fine linen, and he placed the golden chain on his neck.
41:43	And he had him ride in the chariot next to his, and they called before him "Avrech!" ["This is the father (i.e., counselor) of the king"], and he set him over all the land of Egypt.
41:44	And Pharaoh said to Joseph: I am Pharaoh [and I am empowered to decree], and [I decree that] without your consent no man may lift his hand [to arm himself], or his foot [to mount a horse] in the whole land of Egypt.
41:45	And Pharaoh called Joseph "Tzafnath Pa'aneach" ["the unraveler of the hidden"], and he gave him as a wife Asnath the daughter of Poti Fera, the priest of On, [Pothiphar, called "Poti Fera" because, having designs on Joseph, he was rendered impotent (fera).] And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
41:46	And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from before Pharaoh, and he passed through all the land of Egypt.
41:47	And the land was made in the seven years of plenty into fistfuls [i.e., the inhabitants gathered grain, fist upon fist, for storage].
41:48	And he gathered all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and he placed food in the cities. The food [i.e., the soil] of the field of the city which was around it, he placed in it [into the gathered food, to preserve it, (food being best preserved by local soil)].
41:49	And Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, in great quantity, until he [the counter] stopped counting, for there was no count.
41:50	And unto Joseph were born two sons before the advent of the years of famine [(whence we derive that it is forbidden to cohabit in years of famine)], which were begotten to him by Asnath the daughter of Poti Fera, the priest of On.
41:51	And Joseph called the name of the first-born Menasheh: "for G d has made me forget (nashani) all of my toil and all of my father's house."
41:52	And the name of the second he called Ephraim: "for G d has made me fruitful (hifrani) in the land of my affliction."
41:53	And there ended the seven years of plenty which were in the land of Egypt.
41:54	And the seven years of famine began to arrive, as Joseph had said. And there was famine in all of the lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
41:55	And the whole land of Egypt hungered. And the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread. And Pharaoh said to all of Egypt: Go to Joseph. Whatever he tells you, do.
41:56	And the famine was on the "face of all the land" [i.e., the rich], and Joseph opened all (the granaries) where there was (grain), and he sold to Egypt; and the famine waxed strong in the land of Egypt.
41:57	And all the land came to Egypt to Joseph to buy, for the famine was strong in all the land.
42
42:1	And Jacob saw that there was a grain sale in Egypt. And Jacob said to his sons: Why should you be looked upon [strangely by others for not stocking up before your food gives out]?
42:2	And he said: Behold, I have heard that there is a (grain) sale in Egypt. Go down (redu) there [(the gematria of "redu" is 210, intimating the years of servitude in Egypt)], and buy grain for us from there so that we live and not die.
42:3	And the brothers of Joseph [(They went as "the brothers of Joseph," determined to redeem him)], ten, went down to buy grain from Egypt.
42:4	And Benjamin, the brother of Joseph, Jacob did not send with his brothers, saying: Lest he come to harm, [Satan "prosecuting" in time of danger (i.e., on the road)].
42:5	And the children of Israel came, [mingling] in the midst of those who came [(Jacob having instructed them to enter separately so that their strength and beauty not arouse "the evil eye")], for the famine held sway in the land of Canaan.
42:6	And Joseph — he ruled the land. He sold (grain) to all the people of the land. And the brothers of Joseph came, and they prostrated themselves to him with their faces to the ground.
42:7	And Joseph saw his brothers and he recognized them, and he acted like a stranger to them, speaking harshly to them: "Where did you come from!" And they said: From the land of Canaan to buy food.
42:8	And Joseph recognized his brothers, [for they were already bearded when he left them], but they did not recognize him, [for he was unbearded when they parted].
42:9	And Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed of them, [and he realized that they had been fulfilled (for they had bowed down to him)]. And he said to them: You are spies; you have come to see the nakedness ("the weak spots") of the land.
42:10	And they said to him: No, my lord, for your servants have come to buy food.
42:11	We are all [including Joseph] the sons of one man, [(the Holy Spirit animating their words)]. We are honest; your servants were not spies.
42:12	And He said to them: No, but you came to see the nakedness of the land. [For, otherwise, why would you have come through ten different gates and not through one?]
42:13	And they said: We, your twelve servants, are brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and the youngest is with our father this day, and one is not with us, [and we "scattered" to seek him].
42:14	And Joseph said to them: What I spoke of you, that you are spies, [is the truth].
42:15	By this shall you be proved — by the life of Pharaoh, [(Joseph utilizing Pharaoh's name in swearing falsely)] — You shall not go out of here unless your youngest brother comes here.
42:16	Send one of you and let him take your brother; and you shall be sequestered and your words be proved — Is truth with you? And if not [i.e., if you do not bring him], then, by the life of Pharaoh, you are spies.
42:17	And he sequestered them together for three days.
42:18	And Joseph said to them on the third day: Do this and you shall live; I fear G d.
42:19	If you are honest, let one of you be confined in your prison-house, and you, go and bring [to your father's house] provisions [to alleviate] the hunger of [the people of] your houses.
42:20	And your youngest brother bring to me, so that your words be confirmed and you not die. And they did so.
42:21	And they said one to the other: In truth, we are guilty over our brother for having seen the trouble of his soul in his entreating us and not having listened. Therefore, this trouble is come upon us.
42:22	And Reuven answered them, saying: Did I not say to you: "Do not sin against the child?" and you did not heed me; and now his blood is also being demanded ["also," including the blood of "the old one" (Jacob)].
42:23	And they did not know that Joseph understood (what they were saying), for the interpreter [Menasheh] was (i.e., interpreted) between them [and Joseph (when they spoke with him)].
42:24	And he walked off some distance from them and he wept. And he returned and spoke to them, and he took Shimon from them [(It was Shimon who had cast him into the pit and who had said to Levi (37:19): "Behold, this dreamer comes")], and he imprisoned him before their eyes [— and when they left, he released him and gave him food and drink.]
42:25	And Joseph commanded that their vessels be filled with grain, that their money be returned, each to his sack, and that they be given provision for the way. And he did so to them.
42:26	And they lifted their grain onto their asses and they went from there.
42:27	And the one [Levi] opened his sack to give feed to his ass in the night-lodging, and he saw his money, and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.
42:28	And he said to his brothers: My money has been returned, and it, too, [along with the grain] is in my sack. And their hearts went out, and each trembled to his brothers, saying: What is this that G d has done to us [to bring this libel (that we stole the money) upon us]?
42:29	And they came to Jacob their father to the land of Canaan, and they told him all that had befallen them, saying:
42:30	The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and he accused us of spying out the land.
42:31	And we said to him: We are honest; we were not spies.
42:32	We are twelve, brothers, sons of our father. One is not with us, and the youngest this day is with our father in the land of Canaan.
42:33	And the man, the lord of the land, said to us: By this shall I know that you are honest. Your one brother leave with me, and (food for) the hunger of your houses take and go.
42:34	And bring your young brother to me, and I will know that you are not spies and that you are honest. Your brother will I give to you, and you will go about the land [in trade].
42:35	And, as they emptied their sacks, behold, each (found) his money bundle in his sack. And they saw their money bundles, they and their father, and they were afraid.
42:36	And Jacob their father said to them: You have bereaved me [of children. He suspected that they may have killed Shimon or sold him as they did Joseph.] Joseph is not, and Shimon is not, and you would take Benjamin! Upon me have all of them been.
42:37	And Reuven said to his father: You may kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Entrust him to me and I will return him to you.
42:38	And he said: My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead and he alone remains, and if an accident befall him on the way on which you go, then you will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to the grave.
43
43:1	And the famine was sore in the land.
43:2	And it was, when they had finished eating the grain they had brought from Egypt, that their father said to them: Return, buy for us a little food.
43:3	And Judah said to him: The man warned us, saying: You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.
43:4	If you send our brother with us, we shall go down and buy grain for you.
43:5	And if you do not send, we shall not go down. For the man said to us: You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.
43:6	And Israel said: Why did you do evil unto me to tell the man that you had another brother?
43:7	And they said: The man inquired about us and about our families, saying: Is your father still living? Do you have a brother? And we answered him in response to these words. Could we know that he would say "Bring down your brother"?
43:8	And Judah said to Israel his father: Send the child with me and let us arise and go; and we shall live [(the Holy Spirit presaging Jacob's "revival" (45:27)] and we shall not die [of hunger], both we, you, and our little ones, [of a certainty, whereas Benjamin's seizure is only a possibility].
43:9	I will go surety for him; you will require him at my hand. If I do not bring him to you and present him to you [alive], then I shall have sinned against you all of the days [in the world to come].
43:10	For had we not been delayed [by you] we could now have returned twice [with Shimon, and you would have been spared all this suffering].
43:11	And Israel their father said to them: If so, [i.e., if I must send him with you] then do this: Take of the choicest fruits of the land in your vessels, and take a present down to the man: a little balm, and a little honey, resin and laudanum, pistachios and almonds.
43:12	And twice as much money [as you took before] take in your hands, [for the grain price might have risen], and the money returned in the mouth of your bags, return with your hands, for it might have been [forgotten by the overseer] in error.
43:13	And your brother take, and arise, return to the man.
43:14	And may the All-Sufficient grant you mercy before the man, and may he release your "other" [(the Holy Spirit presaging the "release" of Joseph)] brother [Shimon] and Benjamin; and I, [until you return], as I have been bereaved [of Joseph and  Shimon], so will I be bereaved [of Benjamin].
43:15	And the men took this gift, and double the money they took in their hand, and Benjamin, and they arose and went down to Egypt, and they stood before Joseph.
43:16	And Joseph saw Benjamin with them, and he said to the overseer of his house: Bring these men into the house, and [see to it] to slaughter something (for a meal) and prepare it, for with me will these men dine.
43:17	And the man did as Joseph said, and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
43:18	And the men were afraid, for they were brought into the house of Joseph, [this not being customary for those who had come to purchase grain.] And they said: It is because of the money which was returned to our sacks in the beginning that we were brought [into the house], to cast a libel upon us, and to fall upon us, and to take us as slaves, and our asses.
43:19	And they drew near to the man who was over Joseph's house, and they spoke to him at the entrance to the house.
43:20	And they said: We entreat you, my lord. Down did we descend, [we, who were accustomed to feed others,] in the beginning, to buy food.
43:21	And it was, when we came to the inn and we opened our sacks, that, behold, each one's money was in the mouth of his sack, in (full) weight, and we have brought it back in our hand.
43:22	And other money have we brought in our hand to buy grain. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.
43:23	And he said: Peace unto you; do not fear. Your G d [in your merit], and [if that were not sufficient], the G d of your father [in his merit], has given you a prize in your sacks. Your money has come to me. And he brought Shimon out to them.
43:24	And the man [after having been gradually pushed to the entrance of the house] brought the men [again] into Joseph's house. And he gave (them) water, and they washed their feet, and he gave feed to their asses.
43:25	And they decorated the gift, [laying it out in fine vessels] until Joseph came to dine, for they heard that they would take bread [i.e., dine] there.
43:26	And Joseph came to the house, and they brought him the gift in their hands into the house [from the outer hall into the parlor], and they prostrated themselves to him to the ground.
43:27	And he greeted them, and he said: Is your old father well of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?
43:28	And they said: Your servant, our father, is well; he still lives. And they bowed [their heads in response to his greeting] and they prostrated themselves [to the ground].
43:29	And he lifted up his eyes and he saw Benjamin his brother, the son of his mother, and he said: Is this your younger brother of whom you spoke to me? And he said: "May G d grace you, my son," [it already having been said of the other tribes (33:5): "with which G d graced your servant"].
43:30	And Joseph hastened, for his mercies had become enkindled for his brother and he wished to cry, and he went into his chamber and he wept there.
43:31	And he washed his face, and he went out and he "fortified" himself, and he said: Serve bread.
43:32	And they served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him, by themselves. For the Egyptians could not eat with the Hebrews, for it was an abomination to the Egyptians, [the Hebrews eating sheep, which the Egyptians worshiped].
43:33	And they sat [i.e., he sat them in order] before him, the first-born according to his seniority, and the youngest, according to his youth; and the men expressed amaze one to the other.
43:34	And he took portions from before him to them, and the portion of Benjamin was five times that of the others, [Benjamin receiving his own portion, and, in addition, those sent him by Joseph, Asnath, Menasheh, and Ephraim], and they drank and became inebriated with him, [neither he nor they having drunk wine from the day he was sold].
44
44:1	And he charged the one over his house, saying: Fill the sacks of the men with food, as much as they can carry, and place each one's money in the mouth of his sack.
44:2	And my goblet, the silver goblet, place in the mouth of the sack of the youngest and the money of his grain purchase. And he did according to the word of Joseph, who had spoken.
44:3	Morning dawned and the men were sent away, they and their asses.
44:4	They had left the city and had not gone far when Joseph said to the one over his house: Arise, pursue the men, and when you overtake them, say to them: Why did you pay evil for good?
44:5	Is not this what my master drinks in and through which he divines? You have done evil by what you have done.
44:6	And he overtook them, and he spoke these things to them.
44:7	And they said to him: Why should my lord speak such things? It would be profane in your servants to do such a thing!
44:8	Behold, the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks we returned to you from the land of Canaan. How, then, would we steal from your master's house silver or gold!
44:9	With whomever it is found of your servants, he shall die, and we, too, shall be servants to my lord.
44:10	And he said: This, too, is as you say; it is true [that if one among ten is found to have stolen, all should be apprehended, but I shall be liberal, and only] the one with whom it is found shall be my slave, and you will be absolved.
44:11	And they hastened, and each brought his sack down to the ground, and each opened his sack.
44:12	And he searched, beginning with the oldest, [so that they not suspect him of knowing where it was], and finishing with the youngest, and the goblet was found in Benjamin's sack.
44:13	And they rent their garments, and each [individually, without requiring another's assistance] laded his ass, and they returned to the city [(really a metropolis, but, in their eyes, merely a "city" (of ten) in its defenselessness before them)].
44:14	And Judah and his brothers came to the house of Joseph, and he was still there [waiting for them], and they fell before him to the ground.
44:15	And Joseph said to them: What is this deed that you have done? Did you not know that a man such as I could divine [that you had stolen the goblet]?
44:16	And Judah said: What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak and how shall we justify ourselves? [We did not sin in this instance (of the goblet), but] G d has found [a way to exact punishment for] the [former] sin of your servants. We are slaves to my lord, both we, both him in whose hand the goblet has been found.
44:17	And he said: It were profane in me to do this! The man in whose hand the goblet is found — he shall be my servant. And you, go up in peace to your father.
Vayigash
44:18	And Judah drew near to him and he said: I entreat you, my lord, let your servant speak a word [that will enter] in the ears of my lord. And let not your wrath burn against your servant [— whence we may infer that he spoke "strong words" to him], for you are [as eminent in my eyes] as Pharaoh.
44:19	My lord asked his servants: Do you have a father or a brother? [From the very beginning you were plotting against us. Why did you ask all these questions? Were we asking for your daughter in marriage? Or were you asking for our sister?]
44:20	And [in spite of this, we concealed nothing from you, but] we said to my lord: We have an old father and a small child of his old age, and his brother died [(Judah lying here out of fear that he be told to bring him too)], and he alone was left to his mother, [Benjamin having no other brother from that mother], and his father loves him.
44:21	And you said to your servants: Bring him down to me that I may set my eye upon him.
44:22	And we said to my lord: The youth will not be able to leave his father, for if he leaves his father he may die [on the road (as his mother did)].
44:23	And you said to your servants: If your younger brother does not come down with you, you shall see my face no more.
44:24	And it was, when we went up to your servant, my father, and we told him the words of my lord,
44:25	that our father said: Return, buy for us a little food.
44:26	And we said: We cannot go down. If our younger brother is with us then we will go down. For we will not be able to see the man's face if our younger brother is not with us.
44:27	And your servant, my father, said to us: You know that my wife (Rachel) bore me two sons.
44:28	And the one went from me. And I said: Surely, he has been torn. And I have not seen him until now.
44:29	And if you take this one, too, from me, then a mishap will befall him, [for "Satan prosecutes in time of danger"], and you will bring down my hoary head with evil to the grave. [Benjamin is my consolation for Rachel and Joseph. If he dies, it is as if they all died in one day.]
44:30	And now, if I come to your servant, my father, and the youth is not with us, and his soul is bound up with his soul —
44:31	Then it shall be, if he sees that the youth is not (with us), he will die, and your servants will have brought down the hoary head of your servant, our father, with sorrow to the grave.
44:32	[And I am more importunate in this than my other brothers], for your servant has gone surety for the youth to my father, saying: If I do not bring him back to you, then I will have sinned against my father all of the days, [to be cut off in both worlds].
44:33	And now, let your servant stay, I pray you, instead of the youth as a servant to my lord, and let the youth go up with his brothers.
44:34	For how can I go up to my father if the youth is not with me — lest I see the evil that shall befall my father.
45
45:1	And Joseph could not tolerate all [i.e., the Egyptians] standing over him [and witnessing his brothers' shame in his revealing himself to them], and he called: "Take out every man from my presence!" And no man stood with him when Joseph revealed himself to his brothers.
45:2	And he raised his voice in weeping, and (the men of) Egypt heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard it.
45:3	And Joseph said to his brothers: "I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?" And his brothers could not answer him, for they were confounded [with shame] before him.
45:4	And Joseph said to his brothers, [seeing them recoiling from him in shame]: "Draw near to me, I pray you." And they drew near, and he said, [showing them his circumcision]: I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold to Egypt.
45:5	And now, do not be grieved, and do not vex yourselves that you sold me here, because for sustenance did G d send me before you.
45:6	For two years have passed thus far of the [years of] famine in the midst of the land, and five years are yet to come in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.
45:7	And G d has sent me before you to provide for you a remnant in the land and to keep you in life for a great deliverance.
45:8	And now, it is not you who sent me here, but G d. And He made me a "father" [a friend and patron] to Pharaoh and a master to all his house, and a ruler throughout the land of Egypt.
45:9	Hasten and go up to my father [(Eretz Yisrael is the highest of all the lands)], and say to him: Thus said your son Joseph: G d has made me master of all Egypt — come down to me; do not wait.
45:10	And you will sit in the land of Goshen, and you will be near to me, you and your children and your children's children, and your flocks and your herds and all that you have.
45:11	And I will provide for you there. For five years of famine yet remain — lest you and your household and all that you have become impoverished.
45:12	And, behold, your eyes see and the eyes of my brother Benjamin [(Just as I bear no rancor towards Benjamin, who was not a party to my being sold, so I bear none towards you)] that [I am honored and that I am circumcised as you are, and that] the mouth that speaks to you [speaks in the holy tongue].
45:13	And tell my father of all my glory in Egypt and of all that you have seen. And hasten and bring down my father here.
45:14	And he fell on the neck of his brother Benjamin, and he wept [over the two Temples that were destined to be in the portion of Benjamin, which would be destroyed], and Benjamin wept on his neck, [over the sanctuary of Shiloh, that was destined to be in the portion of Joseph, which would be destroyed.]
45:15	And he kissed all his brothers and he wept upon them, and afterwards, [i.e., after they saw him weeping and well disposed towards them,] his brothers spoke with him, [having been ashamed to do so previously].
45:16	And the news reached the house of Pharaoh: "The brothers of Joseph have come." And it was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants.
45:17	And Pharaoh said to Joseph: Tell your brothers: Do this. Load your beasts [with grain], and go to the land of Canaan.
45:18	And take your father and your households and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt [Goshen], and you will eat the fat of the land.
45:19	And you have been commanded [by me to tell them]: Do this: Take for yourselves from the land of Egypt wagons for your little ones and for your wives, and take your father and come.
45:20	And let your eyes not begrudge your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.
45:21	And the children of Israel did so, and Joseph gave them wagons at Pharaoh's bidding, and he gave them provision for the way.
45:22	To all of them he gave, to each man, changes of clothing, and to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing.
45:23	And to his father he sent according to this (count): ten asses carrying of the good of Egypt [(old wine, of which old men are especially fond)], and ten she-asses carrying grain and bread and relish for his father for the road.
45:24	And he sent his brothers and they went. And he said to them: Do not quarrel on the way, [fearing that in their shame over having sold him, they might come to accuse one another of having instigated the act.]
45:25	And they went up from Egypt and they came to the land of Canaan to Jacob their father.
45:26	And they told him: Joseph is still alive, and [they told him] that he was the ruler over all the land of Egypt; and his heart faltered, for he did not believe them.
45:27	And they spoke to him all the words of Joseph that he spoke to them and he saw the wagons (agaloth) that Joseph sent to take him [(a "sign" of Joseph to his father — "eglah (like agalah) arufah" (see Deuteronomy 21) having been Joseph's study when he took leave of his father)]; and the spirit of Jacob their father revived. [The Shechinah, which had departed from him, again reposed upon him.]
45:28	And Israel said: Much [joy still awaits me since] my son Joseph still lives. I shall go and see him before I die.
46
46:1	And Israel journeyed and all that was with him and he came to Beersheva, and he offered sacrifices to the G d of his father Isaac, [(Isaac, not Abraham, the honor of one's father taking precedence to that of his grandfather.)]
46:2	And G d said to Jacob in the visions of the night: Jacob, Jacob [(the doubling connoting affection)], and he said: Here I am, [ready to do Your bidding].
46:3	And He said: I am the Almighty, the G d of your father. Do not fear [being constrained to leave Eretz Yisrael and] going down to Egypt; for a great nation shall I make you there.
46:4	I shall go down with you to Egypt, and I shall also bring you up [to Eretz Yisrael for burial], and Joseph shall place his hand on your eyes.
46:5	And Jacob arose from Beersheva, and the sons of Israel bore Jacob their father and their little ones and their wives on the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to take him.
46:6	And they took their cattle and their substance which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, [(having given their acquisitions in Padan Aram to Esau in exchange for his share in the Mearath Hamachpelah)], and they came to Egypt, Jacob and all of his seed with him.
46:7	His sons and the sons of his sons with him, his daughters and the daughters of his sons, [Serach the daughter of Asher and Yocheved the daughter of Levi]; and all of his seed he brought with him to Egypt.
46:8	And these are the names of the children of Israel who were coming [(at that time)] to Egypt: Jacob and his sons — the first-born of Jacob, Reuven.
46:9	And the sons of Reuven: Chanoch and Falu, and Chetzron and Carmi.
46:10	And the sons of Shimon: Yemuel and Yamin and Ohad and Yachin and Tzochar and Shaul the son of the Canaanitess [Dinah, who had been ravished by a Canaanite, Shchem. (When Shchem was killed, Dinah refused to leave until Shimon swore that he would take her in marriage)].
46:11	And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kehoth, and Merari.
46:12	And the sons of Judah: Er and Onan and Shelah and Peretz and Zarach. And Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Peretz were Chetzron and Chamul.
46:13	And the sons of Issachar: Tola and Puvah and Yov and Shimron.
46:14	And the sons of Zevulun: Sered and Elon and Yachle'el.
46:15	These are the sons of Leah, which she bore to Jacob in Padan Aram [(the males being ascribed to Leah, for when the woman "sows" first, she bears a male)], and Dinah his daughter [(when the man sows first, he begets a female)] — all the souls of his sons and daughters, thirty-three [(with the inclusion of Yocheved the daughter of Levi, who was born just as they entered Egypt.)]
46:16	And the sons of Gad: Tzifyon and Chagi and Shuni and Etzbon, Eri and Arodi and Areli.
46:17	And the sons of Asher: Yimnah and Yishvah and Yishvi and Beriah, and Serach their sister. And the sons of Beriah, Chever and Malkiel.
46:18	These are the sons of Zilpah, who Lavan gave to Leah his daughter. And she bore these to Jacob, sixteen souls.
46:19	The sons of Rachel, the wife [(Rachel being singled out as the "wife," the mainstay)] of Jacob, Joseph and Benjamin.
46:20	And there were born unto Joseph in the land of Egypt — borne to him by Asnath the daughter of Poti Fera, the priest of On — Menasheh and Ephraim.
46:21	And the sons of Benjamin: Bela and Becher and Ashbel and Gera and Naaman, Echi and Rosh and Muppim and Chuppim and Ard.
46:22	These are the sons of Rachel, who were borne to Jacob. All the souls, fourteen.
46:23	And the sons of Dan: Chushim.
46:24	And the sons of Naftali: Yachtze'el and Guni and Yetzer and Shilem.
46:25	These are the sons of Bilhah, who Lavan gave to Rachel his daughter. And she bore these to Jacob. All the souls, seven.
46:26	All of the soul [all one "soul" in that they served one G d] coming [i.e., at the time of their coming] with Jacob to Egypt, the issue of his loins, aside from the wives of the sons of Jacob, all of the soul, sixty-six.
46:27	And the sons of Joseph which were born to him in Egypt, two souls. All of the soul of the house of Jacob that came to Egypt were seventy, [the sixty-six finding Joseph and his two sons there, and Yocheved being born there upon their entry.]
46:28	And Judah he sent before him to Joseph to pave the way [for settlement] before him [(i.e., before he reached there)] to Goshen. And they came to the land of Goshen.
46:29	And Joseph [himself] reined his chariot [in his fervor to honor his father], and he went up to Israel his father in Goshen, and he [Joseph] appeared before him, and he [Joseph] fell on his neck, and he wept and wept on his neck.
46:30	And Israel said to Joseph: If I should die now, [I would be consoled] having seen your face; for you are yet alive.
46:31	And Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's house: I shall go up and tell Pharaoh: My brothers and my father's house from the land of Canaan have come to me.
46:32	And [I shall tell him further that] the men are shepherds, for they were (always) cattle keepers; and their flocks and herds and all that is theirs they have brought.
46:33	And it shall be, when Pharaoh calls to you and says: What is your occupation?
46:34	Then you shall say: Your servants have been cattle keepers from our youths until now, both we and our fathers. (Say this) so that you be settled in the land of Goshen, [which you require for pasture. And he will settle you there, away from him,] for the abomination of Egypt are all who graze sheep, [sheep being an object of idolatry to them,]
47
47:1	And Joseph came and told it to Pharaoh, and he said: My father and my brothers and their flocks and their herds and all that is theirs have come from the land of Canaan, and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.
47:2	And from the "edge" of his brothers, [the least vigorous (so that Pharaoh not impress them into military service)], he took five men, and he presented them to Pharaoh.
47:3	And Pharaoh said to his brothers: What is your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh: Your servants are shepherds, both we and our fathers.
47:4	And they said to Pharaoh: To sojourn in the land did we come. For there is no pasture for your servants' flocks. For the famine is sore in the land of Canaan. And now, let your servants abide in the land of Goshen.
47:5	And Pharaoh said to Joseph: Your father and your brothers have come to you.
47:6	The land of Egypt is before you. In the best of the land settle your father and your brothers. Let them live in the land of Goshen. And if you know of any experts among them [in shepherding], appoint them overseers over mine [i.e., my sheep].
47:7	And Joseph brought Jacob his father and presented him to Pharaoh, and Jacob gave Pharaoh salutation.
47:8	And Pharaoh said to Jacob: How many are the days of the years of your life?
47:9	And Jacob said to Pharaoh: The days of the years of my sojournings are a hundred and thirty years. Few and troubled have been the days of the years of my life, and they did not attain [in good] to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their sojournings.
47:10	And Jacob blessed Pharaoh [in leave-taking], and he left Pharaoh's presence.
47:11	And Joseph settled his father and his brothers, and he gave them a holding in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Ramses [in Goshen], as Pharaoh had commanded.
47:12	And Joseph fed his father and his brothers and all of his father's household bread [sufficient for all, even] for the little ones [to "finger"].
47:13	And [(a reversion to the beginning of the years of famine)] there was no bread in all the land, for the famine was extremely severe, and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished in the famine.
47:14	And Joseph gathered all the money found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan [which they had given him] for the grain that they had purchased, and Joseph brought the money to the house of Pharaoh.
47:15	And the money was exhausted in the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan. And all of Egypt came to Joseph, saying: Give us bread. Why should we die before you? For the money is at an end.
47:16	And Joseph said: Bring your kine and I will give (it) to you for your kine if the money is at an end.
47:17	And they brought their kine to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread for the horses and for the flocks of sheep and for the herds of cattle and the asses. And he led them with bread for all of their kine in that year.
47:18	And that year ended and they came to him in the second year [of the years of famine] and they said to him: We will not conceal it from my lord that the money and the kine are gone [and that all has come] to [the hand of] my lord. Nothing remains before my lord if not our bodies and our ground.
47:19	Why should we perish before your eyes, both we and our ground? Buy us and our ground for bread, and we and our ground will be servants to Pharaoh. And give us seed so that we will live and not die, and the ground will not be desolate. [(Even though Joseph said (45:6): "And five years are yet to come in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest," once Jacob came to Egypt, "blessing came at his heels," they began to sow and the famine ended.)]
47:20	And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh. For every man in Egypt sold his field; for the famine intensified over them. And the land became Pharaoh's possession.
47:21	And he [Joseph] transferred the people to cities [from one city to another as a sign that they no longer had a holding in the land, (Joseph intending in this that his brothers not be branded as "exiles.")] from one end of the border of Egypt to the other.
47:22	Only the land of the priests he did not buy. For the priests had a dole from Pharaoh, and they ate their dole which Pharaoh had given them, wherefore they did not sell their land.
47:23	And Joseph said to the people: Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh. Here is seed for you and sow the ground.
47:24	And it shall be in the ingathering that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own for seed for the field [each year] and for your food and [as food] for those in your houses [manservants and maidservants] and as food for your little ones.
47:25	And they said: You have kept us alive. May we find favor in the eyes of my lord [to do with us as you said] and we will be servants to Pharaoh [to pay him the yearly tribute].
47:26	And Joseph made it a statute [without repeal] until this day over the land of Egypt that a fifth of it reverted to Pharaoh. Only the land of the priests alone did not revert to Pharaoh.
47:27	And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen, and they had a holding in it, and they were fruitful and they multiplied exceedingly.
Vayechi
47:28	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. And the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred and forty-seven years.
47:29	And the days of Israel "drew near to die" [(This phrase always connotes not attaining to the age of one's father. Isaac lived 180 years, and Jacob, 147)]. And he called to his son, to Joseph, [who was in a position to carry out what he asked] and he said to him: If I have now found favor in your eyes, place your hand under my thigh [and swear] that you will do with me lovingkindness and truth. [(The lovingkindness one does with the dead is one of "truth" in that there is no expectation of reciprocation.)] Do not bury me in Egypt.
47:30	And I will lie [i.e., expire] with my fathers, and you shall carry me from Egypt and bury me in their burial place. And he said: I shall do as you say.
47:31	And he said: Swear to me. And he swore to him. And Israel bowed [("In the fox's time (of authority; here, an allusion to Joseph's rule), bow down to him.")] towards the head of the bed [i.e., towards the Shechinah, which rests above the head of the sick.]
48
48:1	And it was, after these things, that it was told to Joseph: Behold, your father is sick; and he took his two sons with him, Menasheh and Ephraim, [for Jacob to bless them before his death].
48:2	And it was told to Jacob: Behold, your son Joseph is coming to you. And Israel strengthened himself and sat up on the bed, [according honor to royalty].
48:3	And Jacob said to Joseph: The Almighty G d appeared to me in Luz in the land of Canaan, and He blessed me.
48:4	And He said to me: Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a congregation of peoples, [two additional tribes issuing from him, Ephraim and Menasheh (see 35:11)], and I will give this land to your seed after you for an eternal blessing.
48:5	And now, your two sons who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you to Egypt — they are mine, [in the number of my other sons, to take a corresponding portion in the land]. Ephraim and Menasheh as Reuven and Shimon shall be to me.
48:6	And if you have issue after them, they shall [not be numbered with my sons, but they shall] be yours. By the name of their brothers [Ephraim and Menasheh] shall they be called in [taking] their inheritance.
48:7	[And though I tax you to carry me for burial to the land of Canaan though I did not exert myself similarly for your mother], for when I came from Padan, Rachel died upon me in the land of Canaan on the road, just a kivrah [a short distance] before Efrath, and I buried her there on the road to Efrath, which is Bethlehem, [without even taking her into Bethlehem — bear no rancor against me for this, for I did so by Divine command, that Rachel might implore mercy for her children when they passed that way in the exile of Nevuzaradan (see Jeremiah 31)].
48:8	And Israel saw the sons of Joseph [and wished to bless them — when the Shechinah departed from him, (for Yeravam and Achav were destined to descend from Ephraim, and Yehu and his sons from Menasheh)], and he said: "Who are these!" [i.e., Whence did they issue that they are not fit to be blessed?]
48:9	And Joseph said to his father: They are my sons, whom G d has given me through this. [He showed him the articles of engagement and the kethubah, and Jacob implored the L rd for the return of the Shechinah, and it again reposed upon him.] And he said: Take them now to me and I will bless them.
48:10	And the eyes of Israel were heavy from age; he could not see. And he drew them near to him, and he kissed them, and he embraced them.
48:11	And Israel said to Joseph: I did not think to see your face, and, behold, G d has shown me your children too!
48:12	And Joseph took them out from between his knees [in order to place them in the right position for blessing; one to the right, the other to the left.] And he prostrated himself to the ground [after he had walked backwards in deference to his father].
48:13	And Joseph took both of them: Ephraim with his right hand, to the left of Israel, and Menasheh [the first-born] with his left hand, to the right of Israel, and he presented (them) to him.
48:14	And Israel stretched out his right hand and placed it on the head of Ephraim, though he was the younger, and his left hand on the head of Menasheh. He crossed his hands designedly, [knowing full well] that Menasheh was the first-born.
48:15	And he blessed Joseph, saying: The G d before whom my fathers walked — Abraham and Isaac — the G d who has sustained me from the very beginning until this day —
48:16	The angel who is wont to redeem me from all evil [e.g., 31:11], let him bless the youths [Menasheh and Ephraim], and let my name be called in them, and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, and may they proliferate [veyidgu, like fish (dagim)] abundantly, [(like fish, not prey to the evil eye)] in the midst of the earth.
48:17	And Joseph saw that his father had placed his right hand on the head of Ephraim, and it was bad in his eyes; and he took his father's hand to remove it from the head of Ephraim to the head of Menasheh.
48:18	And Joseph said to his father: Not so, my father, for this one is the first-born; place your hand on his head.
48:19	And his father demurred and he said: I know, my son, I know [that he is the first-born]. He, too, will be a people, and he, too, will be great, [Gideon being destined to descend from him, for whom the L rd will perform a miracle], but his younger brother will be greater than he, [Joshua being destined to descend from him, who will inherit the land and teach Torah to Israel], and the nations will be full of [the praises of him and] his seed [when he makes the sun stand still in Giveon, and the moon in the valley of Ayalon].
48:20	And he blessed them on that day, saying: In you [i.e., in your blessings] will Israel bless [their sons in future generations], saying: "May G d make you as Ephraim and Menasheh." And he placed Ephraim [in his blessing] before Menasheh [for precedence in the banners (see Numbers 2:18 and 10:22) and for the altar consecration by the princes of the tribes (Ibid. 7)].
48:21	And Israel said to Joseph: Behold, I am going to die, and G d will be with you, and He will return you to the land of your fathers.
48:22	And I, [likewise, for your exertions in my burial,] I have given you Shchem [as a burial plot] as an additional (portion) over your brothers, which [i.e., the city of Shchem] I took from the hand of the Emori with my sword and with my bow [when they sought to kill Shimon and Levi for avenging Dinah].
49
49:1	And Jacob called to his sons and said: Gather together and I will reveal to you what will happen to you in the end of days. [He desired to reveal to them the "end of days" (the time of the Messiah), and the Shechinah departed from him and he began to say other things.]
49:2	Gather together, and hear, sons of Jacob, and hearken to Israel your father.
49:3	Reuven, you are my first-born, my might, and the first of my strength [i.e., the first drop (of semen), Jacob never having emitted semen (until the conception of Reuven)]. [As first-born, yours should have been] an accession of dignity [the priesthood] and an accession of strength [sovereignty],
49:4	[but because of your] precipitousness, like that of [rushing] waters, you shall not gain these accessions. For when you went up on your father's bed [(35:22), this being the "precipitousness"], then you profaned [(the name of) Him, i.e., the Shechinah], who was wont to go up on my bed.
49:5	Shimon and Levi are brothers, [in one counsel against Shchem and against Joseph]. Tools [of murder] stolen [from the blessing of Esau] are their swords.
49:6	In their plot [against Moses in the episode of Zimri of the tribe of Shimon (Numbers 25:6-25)], let my soul not come [i.e., let my name not be mentioned (as, indeed, it was not, it not being written there (Ibid. 14) "the son of Shimon the son of Jacob."] With their assembly [that of Korach of the tribe of Levi], let my glory not be united, [as, indeed, it was not, it not being written there (Ibid. 16:1) "the son of Levi the son of Jacob"]; for in their wrath they slew a man [Chamor and the men of Shchem], and in their wilfullness they razed [i.e., they would raze] an ox [Joseph].
49:7	Cursed be their wrath [(but not they themselves)], for it is fierce, and their anger, for it is sore. I shall divide them [from each other] in Jacob [(Levi shall not be counted among the number of the tribes (for inheritance)], and I shall scatter them in Israel.
49:8	Judah! [(Jacob beckoning him conciliatingly upon observing him to move back in fear of reprimand as his brothers had just been reprimanded) You are not as they, but] your brothers will praise you. Your hand [in the days of David (Judah's descendant)] shall be upon the nape of your foes. The sons of your father shall bow down to you.
49:9	[A prophecy concerning David:] A whelp [when Saul was king, at which time David "led out and brought in Israel" (II Samuel 5:2)], a lion [when David became king] is Judah. From [suspicion of] "tearing" ["Joseph is torn; a wild beast (i.e., Judah, 'the lion') has devoured him" (37:33)] you arose, my son [Judah (see Ibid. 26). And you, likewise, rose above having Tamar killed by admitting the truth (Ibid. 38:26). Therefore,] he crouched, he lay down as a lion [in the days of Solomon (I Kings 5:5): "every man (lying) under his vine, etc."], and as a lioness — Who shall rouse him!
49:10	The scepter shall not depart from Judah [from David on, (an allusion to) the Exilarchs of Bavel, who rule with the scepter by royal edict], nor a lawgiver from between his feet [(an allusion to) the disciples, the Nassiate of Eretz Yisrael] until Shiloh comes, [the king, Messiah, sovereignty being his (shelo)], and to him will be an assembly of nations.
49:11	[A prophecy concerning the land of Judah, which will flow with wine:] He [a man of Judah] will bind to the vine his foal [and will load it from that one vine], and to the [one] vine branch, the colt of his ass. He will wash his raiment in wine, and his garment in the blood of grapes.
49:12	His eyes will be red from [the drinking of] wine, and his teeth white from [an abundance of] milk, [his land providing choice pasture for his herds.]
49:13	Zevulun will dwell on the seacoast and he will be found in the harbor, [Zevulun engaging in commerce to supply the needs of Issachar, engaged in Torah study]; and the end of his (border) will be near Tziddon.
49:14	Issachar is a bony [staunch] ass, [bearing the yoke of Torah], lying down [for repose] between the bounds [of the cities, where he carries his "merchandise"].
49:15	And he saw that repose [i.e., his portion in the land] was good [and fruitful] and that the land was pleasant, and he lowered his shoulder to bear [the yoke of Torah], and he was [to all of his brothers in Israel] a "taskwork servant" [ruling for them on Torah law and on intercalations].
49:16	[A prophecy concerning Samson:] Dan shall take vengeance [of the Philistines] for his people, the tribes of Israel [being] as one [with him].
49:17	Dan will be a serpent on the way, a shififon ["hisser"] on the path, that bites the horse's heels, causing its rider to fall backwards. [Samson, by buckling the temple pillars, killed the Philistines in the temple without touching them directly.
49:18	For Your salvation I hope, O L rd. [An allusion to Samson's "Remember me, I pray You, etc." (Judges 16:28) before dying.]
49:19	Gad, troops (gedudim) will come forth from him. [They will cross the Jordan with their brothers for the conquest of Eretz Israel], and he will troop [back, none missing, in his] tracks [to his inheritance in trans-Jordan].
49:20	[What comes] from [the portion of] Asher, rich shall be his fare, and he shall furnish a royal repast.
49:21	Naftali is a hind let loose [(an allusion to the Genosar Valley, whose fruits are "quick" to ripen)], evoking words of praise.
49:22	A son of favor is Joseph, a son of favor [alighting] upon the eye [of his beholder]. [The] daughters [of Egypt] would step [upon the wall] to gaze [at his beauty].
49:23	And they [(his brothers) and Potiphar and his wife (by incarcerating him)] embittered him, and they [his brothers] became contenders (against him), and the arrow wielders [i.e., the arrow-tongued] hated him.
49:24	And his strength was firmly established, and his arms were goldened [(an allusion to the placing of the signet upon his hand)] by the strength of Jacob — whence [he rose to become] the head-stone of Israel.
49:25	[This (glory) came to you] from the G d of your father, and He shall abet you; and with the Almighty [was your heart when you resisted your mistress] and He will bless you — blessings of heaven from above, blessings of the deep, lying below, blessings of fecundation [(i.e., the males will beget)] and of womb [(i.e., the females will not miscarry)].
49:26	The blessings [i.e., G d's blessings] of your father (Jacob) have surpassed the blessings of [G d to] my begetters (Abraham and Isaac), [my blessings being] until the ends of the hills [the four corners] of the world [(28:14)]. They (the blessings) shall [all] descend upon the head of Joseph and upon the crown of him who was separated from his brothers.
49:27	Benjamin is a wolf that will tear [(a prophetic allusion to (Judges 21:21): "And you will snatch for yourselves, etc." and to Saul's conquest)]. In the morning [of Israel's ascendancy] he [Saul] will eat the spoils, and in the evening [i.e., in their decline, the Babylonian exile], he [(Mordechai and Esther, both of the tribe of Benjamin)] will divide the spoil [of Haman].
49:28	All of these are the tribes of Israel, twelve, and this [i.e., what is stated above] is what their father spoke of them, and he blessed [all of] them; each according to his blessing did he bless "them" [collectively, aside from the individual blessings].
49:29	And he commanded them and he said to them: I shall be gathered unto my people, [(the souls being gathered into a place where they are secreted)]; bury me with my fathers in the cave which is in the field of Efron the Chitti.
49:30	In the cave which is in the field of Machpelah before Mamre in the land of Canaan, which field Abraham bought from Efron the Chitti for a burial holding.
49:31	There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife. There they buried Isaac and Rivkah his wife. And there I buried Leah.
49:32	The purchase of the field and the cave that is in it from the children of Cheth.
49:33	And Jacob finished commanding his sons, and he gathered his feet into the bed, and he expired, and he was gathered to his people [("death" not being ascribed to him)].
50
50:1	And Joseph fell on his father's face, and he wept over him, and he kissed him.
50:2	And Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father. And the physicians embalmed Israel.
50:3	And forty days were completed for him, the days of embalming thus being completed, and Egypt mourned him seventy days [(from the beginning of the embalming) for he had brought blessing upon them, the famine ending and the waters of the Nile being blessed].
50:4	And the days of weeping passed, and Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying: If I have found favor in your eyes, speak thus, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh:
50:5	My father adjured me, saying: I am going to die. In my grave, which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan — there shall you bury me. And now, let me go up, I pray you, and bury my father, and I will return.
50:6	And Pharaoh said: Go up and bury your father, as he adjured you. [If not for your oath I would not let you go.]
50:7	And Joseph went up to bury his father, and there went up with him all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house and all the elders of the land of Egypt.
50:8	And all the house of Joseph and his brothers and his fathers' house. Only their little ones and their flocks and their herds they left in the land of Goshen.
50:9	And there went up with him also chariots, also horsemen. And the camp was greatly laden.
50:10	And they came to the threshing floor of Atad [so called because it was surrounded by thorns (atadim)] on the other side of the Jordan, and they made great and sore lamentation there, and he made mourning for his father, seven days.
50:11	And the inhabitants of the land, the Canaani, saw the mourning in the threshing floor of Atad, and they said: This is great mourning (evel) for Egypt, wherefore they called it Evel-Mitzrayim, which is beyond the Jordan.
50:12	And his sons did to him thus, as he had commanded them [viz. (13)]:
50:13	And his sons [and not his sons' sons (who were born of Canaanite women)] bore him [in the positions he assigned to them (corresponding to the traveling order of the flags in the desert)] to the land of Canaan, and they buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which field Abraham had bought as a burial holding from Efron the Chitti before Mamre.
50:14	And Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers [first] and all who went up with him [(as opposed to their leaving, when the Egyptians went first (8), the Egyptians granting them precedence after witnessing the honor accorded them by the kings of Canaan)] to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
50:15	And the brothers of Joseph saw that their father was dead [i.e., his death was made "manifest" in Joseph's no longer inviting them to dine with him, as he had before in his father's honor], and they said: Perhaps Joseph will hate us and will requite unto us all of the evil which we caused him.
50:16	And they appointed [the sons of Bilhah as messengers] to Joseph to say: Your father commanded before his death, saying [(He had not so commanded, but they "dissimulated for the sake of peace")]:
50:17	Thus shall you say to Joseph: "Forgive, I pray you, the offense of your brothers and their sin. For they requited evil unto you." And now, we pray you, forgive the offense of the servants of the G d of your father. [Though your father is dead, his G d lives, and they are His servants.] And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
50:18	And his brothers also went [in addition to their deputation], and they fell before him and they said: Behold, we are your servants.
50:19	And Joseph said to them: Do not fear, for am I in the place of G d? [If He protected me from all of you, how could I alone injure you?]
50:20	And you thought evil against me. G d thought it for good, in order to do as this day to give life to a great populace.
50:21	And now, do not fear. I will sustain you and your little ones. And he comforted them and he spoke to their hearts [reassuringly].
50:22	And Joseph abode in Egypt, he and his father's house. And Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.
50:23	And Joseph saw of Ephraim sons of the third generation. Also the sons of Machir the son of Menasheh were raised on Joseph's knees.
50:24	And Joseph said to his brothers: I am dying, and G d shall remember you and bring you up from this land to the land that He swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
50:25	And Joseph beswore the children of Israel, saying: G d will remember you and you will bring up my bones from here.
50:26	And Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten, and they embalmed him, and he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.
 
Shemoth
1
1:1	And these are the names of the children of Israel who came to Egypt, [Scripture mentioning them again, after their death, in G d's love for them]; with Jacob, a man and his household they came.
1:2	Reuven, Shimon, Levi, and Judah.
1:3	Issachar, Zevulun, and Benjamin.
1:4	Dan, Naftali, Gad, and Asher.
1:5	And all the souls who issued from Jacob's thigh were seventy souls, and Joseph [— the same Joseph who tended his father's flock] was [king] in Egypt.
1:6	And Joseph died, and all of his brothers, and all of that generation.
1:7	And the children of Israel were fruitful, and teemed [six in one birth], and multiplied, and became exceedingly strong, and the land was filled with them.
1:8	And a new king arose over Egypt who [deported himself as if he] did not know Joseph.
1:9	And he said to his people: Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more numerous and more powerful than we.
1:10	Ready yourselves to plot against it, lest it increase, and it shall be, in the event of war, that it, too, will be added to our foes, and it will war against us and go up out of the land.
1:11	And they placed over it tax officers in order to afflict it with their [Egypt's] toils. And it built, [fortifying them as] treasure cities for Pharaoh — Pithom and Ramses.
1:12	And as [much as] they would afflict it, so did it multiply and so did it burst forth. And they were sick of their lives before the children of Israel.
1:13	And Egypt worked the children of Israel with (back-) breaking labor.
1:14	And they embittered their lives with hard toil: with mortar, and with brick, and with all the labor of the field; all of the labor with which they worked them was (back-) breaking.
1:15	And the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, the name of the one, Shifrah [Yocheved, so called because she "beautifies" (meshapereth) the infant], and the name of the second, Puah [Miriam, so called because she "coos" (poah) to the infant].
1:16	And he said: When you deliver the Hebrew women, and you see upon the birth-stool that it is a son, then you shall kill him [(his astrologers having told him that a male would be born who would save Israel)], and if it is a daughter, then she shall live.
1:17	And the midwives feared G d and they did not do as the king of Egypt spoke to them, and they sustained the males.
1:18	And the king of Egypt called to the midwives and said to them: Why have you done this thing and sustained the males?
1:19	And the midwives said to Pharaoh: For not as the Egyptian women are the Hebrew women, for they are [as expert as] midwives. Before the midwives come to them, they are delivered [of themselves].
1:20	And G d did good unto the midwives, and the people multiplied and grew very strong.
1:21	And it was, because the midwives feared G d, that He made them houses [the houses of the Cohanim and the Levites from Yocheved, and the house of kingdom from Miriam (this being "the good" that He did unto them)].
1:22	And Pharaoh commanded his entire people, saying: Every son that is born, into the Nile shall you throw him, and every daughter shall you keep alive. [On the day of Moses' birth, Pharaoh's astrologers told him that the Jewish savior had been born and that he would be smitten by water, for which reason he decreed that all males be cast into the Nile — not knowing that Moses was destined to be "smitten" through the waters of Merivah (Numbers 20:13)].
2
2:1	And there went a man from the house of Levi and took the daughter of Levi [after he had separated from her because of Pharaoh's decree (to drown the males)].
2:2	And the woman conceived and bore a son, and she saw that he was good, [the house being filled with light at his birth], and she hid him for three months.
2:3	And she could conceal him no longer, and she took for him a reed casque [resistant to hard and soft], and she coated it with loam [on the inside] and with pitch [on the outside, so that "that tzaddik" not smell the foul odor of the pitch], and she put the child in it, and she placed it in the rushes by the banks of the Nile.
2:4	And his sister stood from afar to know what would be done with him.
2:5	And the daughter of Pharaoh went down to the Nile to bathe, and her maidens walked by the riverside, and she saw the casque in the midst of the rushes, and she sent her handmaid and she took it.
2:6	And she opened it and she saw the child, and, behold, a youth crying [(His voice was as that of a youth)] and she pitied him and she said: This is one of the Hebrew children.
2:7	And his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter: Shall I go and call for you a Hebrew nursing woman to nurse the child for you? [many Egyptian women having attempted to nurse him — without success (Moses being destined to speak with the Shechinah)].
2:8	And Pharaoh's daughter said to her: Go. And the maiden went [She went with alacrity, like a youth], and she called the child's mother.
2:9	And Pharaoh's daughter said to her: Take [Heilichi (hei lichi — "This is yours," an unwitting prophecy)] this child and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wage. And the woman took the child and she nursed it.
2:10	And the child grew, and she brought it to Pharaoh's daughter, and he was a son to her. And she called his name Mosheh, saying: "For out of the water did I take him" (meshithihu)].
2:11	And it was in those days that Moses grew [in greatness, Pharaoh appointing him over his house], and he went out to his brothers and he saw [i.e., he took to heart] their toils, and he saw an Egyptian man [an overseer] striking a Hebrew man [an officer] of his brothers.
2:12	And he turned here and there and he saw that there was no man [destined to issue from the Egyptian as a proselyte], and he smote the Egyptian and he buried him in the sand.
2:13	And he went out on the second day, and, behold, two Hebrew men [Dathan and Aviram] quarreling, and he said to the wicked one ["wicked" by reason of lifting his hand to strike]: Why would you strike your fellow [your "fellow" in wickedness]?
2:14	And he said: Who made you a man [(when you are yet a youth)], an officer and a judge over us? Would you speak [the Ineffable Name] to kill me as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses was afraid, and he said: In truth, the thing has become known.
2:15	And Pharaoh heard this thing [through Dathan and Aviram], and he sought to kill Moses [He handed him over to the executioner, but the sword did not prevail against him (see 18:4)], and Moses fled from Pharaoh, and he abode in the land of Midian, and he sat at the well, [patterning himself after Jacob, who found his match thereby].
2:16	And the priest of Midian [the chief among them (who had given up idolatry)] had seven daughters, and they came and drew water and they filled up the trough to give their father's flock to drink.
2:17	And the shepherds came and drove them away [because of the ban (on their father)], and Moses arose and he rescued them, and he gave their flock to drink.
2:18	And they came to Reuel their father, and he said: Why did you hasten to come today?
2:19	And they said: An Egyptian man rescued us from the shepherds, and he also drew water for us, and he gave the flock to drink.
2:20	And he said to his daughters: And where is he? Why did you leave the man? Call him and let him eat bread. [Perhaps he will marry one of you.]
2:21	And Moses consented to remain with the man, and he gave Tzipporah his daughter to Moses (as a wife).
2:22	And she bore a son and he called his name Gershom. For he said: I was a stranger (ger) in a foreign land.
2:23	And it was in the course of those many days [when Moses was in Midian] that the king of Egypt died [(He was stricken with leprosy, tantamount to death, and slaughtered Jewish infants and bathed in their blood)], and the children of Israel moaned under the toil, and they cried out, and their outcry ascended to G d from the toil.
2:24	And G d heard their outcry, and G d remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
2:25	And G d saw the children of Israel, and G d knew [i.e., He "took it to heart."]
3
3:1	And Moses grazed the flock of Yithro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock by way of the wilderness [so that it not graze in others' fields], and he came to [what was later called] the mountain of G d, to Chorev.
3:2	And an angel of the L rd appeared to him in the heart of the fire in the midst of the bush, [G d "identifying Himself" with the sufferings of Israel]. And he saw, and, behold, the bush was burning with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
3:3	And Moses said: I will turn away thither and see this great sight, why the bush is not consumed.
3:4	And the L rd saw that he had turned aside to see. And G d called to him from the midst of the bush, and He said: Moses, Moses. And he said: Here I am.
3:5	And He said: Do not come near here. Remove your shoes from your feet, for the place that you are standing upon is holy ground.
3:6	And He said: I am the G d of your father, the G d of Abraham, the G d of Isaac, and the G d of Jacob. And Moses covered his face, for he was afraid to look at G d.
3:7	And the L rd said: I have seen the afflictions of My people who are in Egypt, and their outcry have I heard under their taskmasters, for I have known [i.e., taken to heart] their tribulations.
3:8	And I went down to save it from the hand of Egypt and to bring it up from that land to a good and broad land, to a land flowing milk and honey, to the place of the Canaani, the Chitti, the Emori, the Perizi, the Chivi, and the Yevussi.
3:9	And now, the outcry of the children of Israel has come to Me, and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.
3:10	And now, go, and I will send you to Pharaoh, and you will take out My people, the children of Israel, from Egypt.
3:11	And Moses said to G d: Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh [i.e., How am I worthy that I should speak with kings], and [how have the Jews merited it] that I should take the children of Israel out of Egypt?
3:12	And He said [(in answer to "Who am I?") It is not you who is the protagonist here,] for I shall be with you, and this [the non-consumed bush] is the sign for you that I have sent you [(and it is in My power to save.) And, in answer to "How have the Jews merited it, etc.", there is a great thing in store for them, viz.:] when you take the people out of Egypt, you will serve G d on this mountain [and receive the Torah there].
3:13	And Moses said to G d: Behold, when I come to the children of Israel and say to them: "The G d of your fathers sent me to you," and they say to me: "What is His name?" what shall I tell them?
3:14	And G d said to Moses: I shall be [with them in this affliction] as I shall be [with them in the bondage of the other kingdoms. (Moses replied: "Sufficient the suffering unto its time!")] And He [in accord] said: Thus shall you say to the children of Israel: "I shall be" sent me to you.
3:15	And G d said further to Moses: Thus shall you say to the children of Israel: The L rd, the G d of your fathers, the G d of Abraham, the G d of Isaac, and the G d of Jacob, sent me to you. This [the Tetragrammaton] is My name forever (leolam) [written as "le'alem" ("to be concealed," i.e., not to be pronounced)], and this ["A-do-nai"] is My remembrance [i.e., pronunciation] from generation to generation.
3:16	Go and gather the elders [i.e., the dignitaries] of Israel, and say to them: The L rd, the G d of your fathers, has appeared to me — the G d of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob — saying: I have remembered you ("pakod, etc.") and what has been done to you in Egypt.
3:17	And I have said that I will bring you up from the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaani, the Chitti, the Emori, the Perizi, the Chivi, and the Yevussi to a land flowing milk and honey.
3:18	And they will hearken to your voice, [this formula ("pakod, etc.") having been handed down to them as a "password" from Jacob and Joseph (Genesis 50:24-25)], and you and the elders of Israel shall come to the king of Egypt and say to him: The L rd, the G d of the Hebrews, has visited us; and now, let us go, we pray you, a distance of three days in the desert, and we shall sacrifice to the L rd our G d.
3:19	And I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, if not by [My manifesting] a strong hand.
3:20	And I will stretch out My hand and I will smite Egypt with all of My wonders which I shall do in its midst, and then he will send you out.
3:21	And I will put the favor of this people in the eyes of Egypt; and when you go, you will not go empty-handed.
3:22	And a woman shall ask of her neighbor and of the woman who lives in her house articles of silver and articles of gold and garments, and you shall put them on your sons and on your daughters, and you shall empty out Egypt.
4
4:1	And Moses answered and he said: But they will not believe me, and they will not hearken to my voice; for they will say: The L rd did not appear to you.
4:2	And the L rd said to him: "What is this in your hand?" And he said: "A staff."
4:3	And He said: Throw it to the ground. And he threw it to the ground and it became a serpent, [a "hint" to Moses that he had plied the serpent's craft — slander (in saying that the Jews would not believe him)], and Moses fled from before it.
4:4	And the L rd said to Moses: Stretch out your hand and seize its tail. And he stretched out his hand and grasped it, and it became a staff in his hand.
4:5	So that they believe that the L rd appeared to you, the G d of their fathers, the G d of Abraham, the G d of Isaac, and the G d of Jacob.
4:6	And the L rd said to him again: Put your hand into your bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom and he took it out, and, behold, it was leprous as snow [(leprosy being the punishment for slander (see Numbers 12)].
4:7	And He said: Return your hand to your bosom, and he returned his hand to his bosom. And he took it from his bosom, and, behold, it had resumed its fleshy appearance, [whence it is derived that G d's goodly measure is more expeditious than His punitive one ("from his bosom," as opposed to "took it out," above, implying that it had healed upon contact with his bosom)].
4:8	And it shall be, if they do not believe you, and they do not hearken to the message of the first sign, then they will believe the message of the last sign, [already having precedent (— as in the instance of Pharaoh and Avimelech, who were smitten with plague because of Sarah —) that the intenders of harm to them are smitten with plague.]
4:9	And it shall be, if they do not believe, also these two signs, and they do not hearken to your voice, then you shall take of the waters of the Nile, and you shall spill it upon the dry land. And the waters that you take from the Nile — they shall become blood upon the dry land.
4:10	And Moses said to the L rd: I pray You, O L rd, I am not a man of words, also [(connoting an additional day)] from yesterday, also from the day before, also from when You began to speak to Your servant [this being the seventh day of Moses' opposition to the mission (in deference to Aaron's seniority)]; for heavy of speech and heavy of tongue am I.
4:11	And the L rd said to him: Who made a mouth for man, or who makes one mute or deaf or seeing or blind? Is it not I, the L rd?
4:12	And now, go, and I shall be with your mouth, and I will teach you what to speak.
4:13	And he said: I pray You, O L rd, send, now, by the hand of [him] You are wont to send [i.e., Aaron].
4:14	And the anger of the L rd burned against Moses, and He said: Is not Aaron your brother the Levite? [i.e., He was destined to be the Levite, and you, the Cohein — Now, he shall be the Cohein, and you, the Levite]. I knew that he shall surely speak. And, also, behold, he shall come out towards you [when you go to Egypt] and he shall see you and he shall rejoice in his heart [and he will not (as you think) be offended by your rise to eminence (for which reason Aaron merited the choshen, the breast-plate, worn over the heart)].
4:15	And you shall speak to him, and you shall place the words in his mouth, and I shall be with your mouth and with his mouth; and I shall teach you what to do.
4:16	And he shall speak on your behalf to the people, and he shall be a spokesman for you [in that you are "heavy of speech"], and you shall be a master to him.
4:17	And this staff take in your hand, wherewith you shall do all the signs.
4:18	And Moses went and he returned to Yether, his father-in-law [to be granted leave to go, for he had sworn to (remain with) him], and he said to him: Let me go, I pray you, and return to my brothers who are in Egypt and see if they still live. And Yithro said to Moses: Go to peace.
4:19	And the L rd said to Moses in Midian: Go, return to Egypt, for all the men who sought your life [Dathan and Aviram] have died. [They were reduced to poverty, which is tantamount to death.]
4:20	And Moses took his wife and his sons, and he rode them on the ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And [before returning to Egypt] Moses took the staff of G d in his hand [(there being no "before" and "after" in Scripture)].
4:21	And the L rd said to Moses: When you go to return to Egypt, see [i.e., give heart to] all of the wonders that I have placed in your hand [(those mentioned later (7:9)] and do them before Pharaoh, and I shall strengthen his heart and he shall not send the people.
4:22	And you shall say to Pharaoh [when he hardens his heart against sending out the Jews]: Thus said the L rd: "My first-born son is Israel" [(an expression of grandeur)].
4:23	And I say to you [by word of the L rd]: Send out My son and let him serve Me. And if you refuse to send him, behold, I shall kill your first-born son [(the last plague being mentioned as a threat in that it is the severest)].
4:24	And he [Moses] was on the way in the lodging when [an angel of] the L rd encountered him and sought to kill him [for remissness in the circumcision of his son].
4:25	And Tzipporah took a flint and cut off the foreskin of her son and she cast it at his [Moses'] feet, and she said [about her son]: "For you are a groom of blood to me" [i.e., You would bring about the death of my "groom" (Moses)].
4:26	And he [the angel] let go of him. Then she said: "A groom of blood for [i.e., by reason of remissness in] circumcision.
4:27	And the L rd said to Aaron: Go towards Moses to the desert. And he went, and he met him in the mountain of G d, and he kissed him.
4:28	And Moses told Aaron all the words of the L rd wherewith He had sent him, and all the signs which He had charged him with.
4:29	And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel.
4:30	And Aaron spoke all the things that the L rd spoke to Moses, and he performed the signs before the eyes of the people.
4:31	And the people believed when they heard that the L rd had remembered the children of Israel and that He had seen their affliction. And they bowed and they prostrated themselves.
5
5:1	And afterwards Moses and Aaron came [(but the elders, in fear of going, fell off one by one)], and they said to Pharaoh: Thus said the L rd, the G d of Israel: Send My people that they may make a festival unto Me in the desert.
5:2	And Pharaoh said: Who is the L rd that I should hearken to His voice to send out Israel? I do not know the L rd and I shall also not send out Israel.
5:3	And they said: The G d of the Hebrews revealed Himself to us. Let us go, we pray you, a three days' distance in the desert and sacrifice to the L rd our G d lest He smite us [(instead of "smite you," in deference to royalty)] with pestilence or with the sword.
5:4	And the king of Egypt said to them: Why, Moses and Aaron, would you distance the people from their work? Go to your labors [at home (the tribe of Levi being exempt from the servitude of Egypt)].
5:5	And Pharaoh said: The people of the land are many now, and you would quit them of their toils.
5:6	And Pharaoh commanded on that day the taskmasters [Egyptians] of the people and its officers [Hebrews], saying:
5:7	Do not continue to give stubble to the people [to knead with clay] to make bricks as heretofore. Let them go and collect stubble for themselves.
5:8	And the quota of bricks which they made heretofore you shall impose upon them. Do not reduce it. For they are idling. That is why are they crying out: "Let us go and sacrifice to our G d!"
5:9	Let the labor be heavy on the men and let them do it, and let them not speak vain words.
5:10	And the taskmasters of the people went out, and its officers, and they said to the people: Thus has Pharaoh said: I shall not give you stubble.
5:11	You, go [quickly]; take for yourselves stubble wherever you find it. For nothing must be diminished from your work [quota].
5:12	And the people spread out throughout the land of Egypt to gather straw for the stubble.
5:13	And the taskmasters pressed [upon them], saying: Finish your work, the [entire] day's quota in its day, as it was when the stubble was [supplied to you].
5:14	And the officers of the children of Israel, whom the taskmasters of Pharaoh placed over them, were smitten, (the taskmasters) saying: Why did you not finish your brick-making quota as of three days ago, both yesterday and today?
5:15	And the officers of the children of Israel came and they cried out to Pharaoh, saying: Why should you do thus to your servants!
5:16	Stubble is not given to your servants, and bricks they say to us: Make! And, behold, your servants are smitten, and [this thing brings] sin upon your people.
5:17	And he said: You are idlers, idlers! That is why you say: Let us go and sacrifice to the L rd.
5:18	And now, go and work. And stubble will not be given to you, and produce the quota of bricks!
5:19	And the officers of the children of Israel saw them [their fellow Jews who were under them] in misfortune, [the officers being constrained] to say: Do not diminish from your bricks the quota of each day in its day.
5:20	And they [(men of Israel)] met Moses and Aaron standing opposite them when they left Pharaoh.
5:21	And they said to them: May the L rd reveal Himself to you and judge how you have made us contemptible in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants to put a sword in their hands to kill us!
5:22	And Moses returned to the L rd and he said: O L rd, why have You done evil to this people [and] why have You sent me!
5:23	And from the time I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done [increasingly greater] evil to this people, and You have not saved Your people.
6
6:1	And the L rd said to Moses: [Because you questioned My providence,] now you shall see — what I shall do to Pharaoh, [but not what shall be done to the seven nations when I bring Israel into Eretz Yisrael]. For with a strong hand [that I shall wield against him] he shall send them out, and with a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land [against their will (the Jews not having time to prepare their food)].
Va'eira
6:2	And G d spoke ["strong words"] to Moses [for his presumptuousness (5:22)] and He said to him: I am the L rd [Yod-Keh-Vav-Keh (connoting "trusted for recompense," for which reason I sent you)].
6:3	And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as Kel shakkai ("the All-Sufficient G d"); but [by] My name Yod-Keh-Vav-Keh I was not realized for them, [for I promised them but did not fulfill].
6:4	And also [when I appeared to them as Kel Shakkai], I set up My covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan [(see Genesis 17:1 and 8, 26:3, 35:9, 11, 12)], the land of their sojournings, where they dwelt.
6:5	And also, [having set up the covenant and being obliged to fulfill it], I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel under the Egyptian servitude, and I have remembered My covenant [(Genesis 15:14) wherein I promised to punish the enslaving nation].
6:6	Therefore, [by that oath] tell the children of Israel that I am the L rd [trusted to fulfill], and I shall take you out from under the toils of Egypt [for thus did I promise (Genesis 15:14)], and I will deliver you from their labors, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments.
6:7	And I will take you to Me as a people, and I will be to you as a G d; and you will know that I am the L rd your G d who took you out from under the toils of Egypt.
6:8	And I shall bring you to the land which I lifted My hand [i.e., which I swore by My throne] to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And I shall give it to you as an inheritance. I am the L rd.
6:9	And Moses spoke thus to the children of Israel and they did not hearken to Moses [i.e., they were not comforted by him], for shortness of breath [in anguish] and soreness of toil.
6:10	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
6:11	Come and speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.
6:12	And Moses spoke before the L rd, saying: If the children of Israel did not heed me, how should Pharaoh heed me! And I am of uncircumcised [i.e., occluded] lips.
6:13	And the L rd spoke to Moses and to Aaron [who, because of Moses' demurral (above) was made his spokesman], and He charged them concerning the children of Israel and concerning [their embassy to] Pharaoh, king of Egypt [(the charge continuing, Ibid. 29)] to take the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
6:14	These are the heads of their fathers' houses: the sons of Reuven, the first-born of Israel [(The genealogy of Moses and Aaron is traced from its beginning in the line of Jacob)]: Chanoch and Falu, Chetzron and Carmi. These are the families of Reuven.
6:15	And the sons of Shimon: Yemuel and Yamin and Ohad and Yachin and Tzochar and Shaul the son of the Canaanitess. These are the families of Shimon.
6:16	And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their births: Gershon and Kehoth and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi were one hundred and thirty-seven years [(Levi's years being mentioned to apprise us of the years of the bondage, there being no bondage while any of Jacob's sons lived, and Levi being the longest-lived of them)].
6:17	The sons of Gershon: Livni and Shimi, according to their families.
6:18	And the sons of Kehoth: Amram and Yitzhar and Chevron and Uziel. And the years of the life of Kehoth were one hundred and thirty-three years [(whence it is derived that the four hundred years of Israel's servitude (Genesis 15:13) date from the birth of Isaac)].
6:19	And the sons of Merari: Machli and Mushi. These are the families of Levi according to their births.
6:20	And Amram took Yocheved his aunt [his father's sister; the daughter of Levi, the sister of Kehoth] to himself as a wife. And she bore to him Aaron and Moses. And the years of the life of Amram were one hundred and thirty-seven years.
6:21	And the sons of Yitzhar: Korach and Nefeg and Zichri.
6:22	And the sons of Uziel: Mishael and Eltzafan and Zichri.
6:23	And Aaron took Elisheva the daughter of Aminadav, the sister of Nachshon, to himself as a wife [(whence it is derived that in taking a wife one should inquire about her brothers)], and she bore to him Nadav and Avihu and Elazar and Ithamar.
6:24	And the sons of Korach: Assir and Elkanah and Aviasaf. These are the families of the Korchi.
6:25	And Elazar the son of Aaron took one of the daughters of Putiel [(of the seed of Yithro, who fattened (pitem) calves for idolatry, and of the seed of Joseph, who made light of (pitpet) his evil inclination (in resisting Potiphar's wife)] to himself as a wife, and she bore Pinchas unto him. These are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.
6:26	It [i.e., the afore-mentioned] are [the] Aaron and Moses whom the L rd told: Take the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt with their hosts [(all of their hosts according to their tribes)].
6:27	They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to take the children of Israel out of Egypt. [Those who were commanded — those are the ones who fulfilled.] It was [the same] Moses and Aaron [(single-minded) in their mission and in their righteousness].
6:28	And it was on the day that the L rd spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt
6:29	that the L rd spoke to Moses saying [(a reversion to (11) after the genealogical hiatus)]: I am the L rd [trusted to send you and to fulfill My embassy]. Speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, all that I speak to you.
6:30	And Moses said before the L rd: I am uncircumcised [i.e., occluded] of lips. How, then, will Pharaoh heed me! [(a reversion to (12)].
7
7:1	And the L rd said to Moses: See, I have made you an overlord to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother shall be your spokesman.
7:2	You speak [(once, for each embassy)] all that I shall command you, and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh, [elaborating on what you have said], that he send the children of Israel from his land.
7:3	And I shall harden the heart of Pharaoh [since he has inveighed against Me and since I know that he is not inclined to repent wholeheartedly], and I shall [in consequence] increase My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt [for the "edification" of Israel].
7:4	And Pharaoh will not pay heed to you and I shall place My hand against Egypt [to smite them], and I shall bring forth My hosts, My people, the children of Israel, from the land of Egypt with great judgments.
7:5	And Egypt will know that I am the L rd when I stretch forth My hand against Egypt; and I shall take out the children of Israel from their midst.
7:6	And Moses and Aaron did as the L rd commanded them; so did they do.
7:7	And Moses was eighty years old and Aaron was eighty-three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.
7:8	And the L rd said to Moses and to Aaron:
7:9	When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying: Give us a wonder [i.e., a sign proving the potency of your sender], then say to Aaron: Take your staff and cast it before Pharaoh; it shall be a serpent.
7:10	And Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh and they did thus, as the L rd had commanded. And Aaron cast his staff before Pharaoh and before his servants and it became a serpent.
7:11	And Pharaoh, too, called to the wise men and the magicians; and the necromancers of Egypt did likewise through their charms.
7:12	And each cast down his staff and they became serpents, and the staff of Aaron [(i.e., after the serpent had reverted to a staff)] swallowed their staffs.
7:13	And Pharaoh's heart became strong and he did not pay heed to them, as the L rd had spoken.
7:14	And the L rd said to Moses: The heart of Pharaoh is hard. He refuses to send the people.
7:15	Go to Pharaoh in the morning. Behold, he goes out to the water in the morning [to ease himself by the Nile (in secret, so that his people not be disabused of his godhood)]. And stand opposite him on the bank of the Nile; and the staff which turned into a serpent take in your hand.
7:16	And you shall say to him: The L rd, the G d of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying: Send out My people that they may serve Me in the desert; and you have not heeded (this) until now.
7:17	Thus says the L rd: By this you will know that I am the L rd. Behold, I will strike with the staff in my hand the waters of the Nile and they shall turn to blood, [G d first smiting their god, the Nile (their water source in the absence of rain), and then, they themselves.]
7:18	And the fish in the Nile shall die, and the Nile shall reek, and the Egyptians shall weary themselves [in quest of a "cure"] to drink water from the Nile.
7:19	And the L rd said to Moses: Say to Aaron: Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt [(Because the Nile "protected" Moses when he was cast into it (as an infant), it was not smitten through him, but through Aaron for the plagues of blood and frogs)], over their rivers, over their canals, over their standing waters, and over all their gatherings of water, and they shall be blood. And there will be blood in all the land of Egypt [even in the bath-houses and house-tubs] and in [water in] wood and stone [vessels].
7:20	And Moses and Aaron did thus, as the L rd had commanded. And he raised the staff and he smote the waters in the Nile before the eyes of Pharaoh and before the eyes of his servants. And all the water in the Nile turned to blood.
7:21	And the fish in the Nile died, and the Nile reeked, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile. And the blood was throughout the land of Egypt.
7:22	And the necromancers of Egypt did likewise through their charms. And Pharaoh's heart was strengthened and he did not pay heed to them, as the L rd had spoken.
7:23	And Pharaoh turned and came to his house, and he did not set his heart to this [the plague of blood], too, [as well as (not) to the staff's turning into a serpent].
7:24	And all of Egypt dug around the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink from the waters of the Nile.
7:25	And seven days [of plague] were completed after the L rd had smitten the Nile [before it returned to its original state, each plague obtaining for a quarter of a month, and three-quarters for warning.]
7:26	And the L rd said to Moses: Come to Pharaoh and say to him: Thus said the L rd: Send out My people and let them serve Me.
7:27	And if you are a refuser, (not) to send out, behold, I shall smite all of your border with frogs.
7:28	And the Nile shall swarm frogs, and they shall go up [from the Nile] and come [first] into your house, [Pharaoh having counseled first against the Jews (1:9)], and into your bed chamber and upon your bed, and [then] into the house of your servants, and into your people, and into your ovens and into your kneading troughs.
7:29	And in you [i.e., in your innards] and in your people and in all of your servants shall the frogs go up.
8
8:1	And the L rd said to Moses: Say to Aaron: Stretch your hand with the staff over the rivers, over the water courses, and over the ponds, and bring up the frogs upon the land of Egypt.
8:2	And Aaron stretched forth his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frog [swarm] came up and covered the land of Egypt.
8:3	And the necromancers did likewise through their charms, and the frogs came up upon the land of Egypt.
8:4	And Pharaoh called to Moses and to Aaron and he said: Entreat the L rd that he remove the frogs from me and from my people, and I will send out the people and they will sacrifice to the L rd.
8:5	And Moses said to Pharaoh: "Presume" over me as to when I should entreat for you and for your servants and for your people to cut off the frogs from you and from your houses. Only in the Nile shall they remain.
8:6	And he said: [Entreat today] for tomorrow [i.e., that they be cut off tomorrow]. And he said: As you say. So that you know that there is none like the L rd our G d.
8:7	And the frogs will depart from you and from your houses and from your servants and from your people; only in the Nile shall they remain.
8:8	And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh and Moses cried out to the L rd over the frogs which He had brought upon Pharaoh.
8:9	And the L rd did according to the word of Moses and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courtyards, and out of the fields.
8:10	And they piled them up in heaps, and the land reeked.
8:11	And Pharaoh saw that there was relief, and his heart was hardened and he did not heed them, as the L rd had spoken [(7:4)].
8:12	And the L rd said to Moses: Say to Aaron: Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth [(It was not fitting that the earth be struck by Moses, for it had "protected" him when he had killed the Egyptian, for which reason Aaron was bidden to strike it)], and it will be lice in all the land of Egypt.
8:13	And they did so. And Aaron stretched forth his hand with his staff and he struck the dust of the earth, and the louse [swarm] was in man and beast. All the dust of the earth was lice in the whole land of Egypt.,
8:14	And the necromancers did likewise with their charms to bring forth the lice, [attempting to create them and bring them forth from some other place], but they could not do so, [for the demon (of their art) is ineffective with a creature smaller than a barley corn]. And the louse [swarm] was in man and beast.
8:15	And the necromancers said to Pharaoh: It is the finger of G d, [and not magic]. And the heart of Pharaoh was strengthened and he did not heed them, as the L rd had spoken [(7:4)].
8:16	And the L rd said to Moses: Rise early in the morning and appear before Pharaoh. Behold, he goes out to the water. And you shall say to him: Thus said the L rd: Send out My people and let them serve Me.
8:17	For if you do not send My people, I shall incite, against you and your servants and your people and your houses, the mixed multitude [of wild animals, serpents, and scorpions]. And the houses of Egypt will be filled with the mixed multitude, and also the ground on which they are.
8:18	And I will set apart on that day the land of Goshen on which My people stands, that there be no mixed multitude there. So that you know that I am the L rd [whose decree is fulfilled] in the midst of the land [though My shechinah is in the heavens].
8:19	And I will make a deliverance [which shall distinguish] between My people and your people. Tomorrow will this sign be.
8:20	And the L rd did so, and a sore mixed multitude came into the house of Pharaoh and into the house of his servants; and in all the land of Egypt the land was being ravaged by the mixed multitude.
8:21	And Pharaoh called to Moses and to Aaron and he said: Go and slaughter to G d in the land, [in your place; not in the desert].
8:22	And Moses said: It is not right to do this, for the abomination of Egypt [i.e., what they hold sacred] we will slaughter to the L rd our G d. Will we slaughter the abomination of Egypt before their eyes and they not stone us?
8:23	We shall go a three days' journey into the desert, and we shall sacrifice to the L rd our G d, as He shall say to us.
8:24	And Pharaoh said: I shall send you, and you shall sacrifice to the L rd your G d in the desert. Only do not go too far; entreat for me.
8:25	And Moses said: Behold, I am leaving you, and I shall entreat the L rd, and the mixed multitude shall depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people tomorrow. Only let Pharaoh not continue to dissemble, not to send the people to sacrifice to the L rd.
8:26	And Moses went out from Pharaoh and he prayed [devoutly] to the L rd.
8:27	And the L rd did as Moses spoke and He removed the mixed multitude from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; not one remained. [(But they did not die, as the frogs did, so that no benefit be derived from their hides.)]
8:28	And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time as well, and he did not send out the people.

9:1	And the L rd said to Moses: Come to Pharaoh and speak to him: Thus said the L rd, the G d of the Hebrews: Send out My people and let them serve Me.
9:2	For if you refuse to send (them) and continue holding them,
9:3	Behold, the hand of the L rd is in your cattle in the field, in the horses, in the asses, in the camels, in the herd, and in the flock — a very sore pestilence.
9:4	And the L rd will distinguish between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt, and there will die naught of all that appertains to the children of Israel.
9:5	And the L rd set a time, saying: Tomorrow the L rd shall do this thing in the land.
9:6	And the L rd did this thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died. And of the cattle of the children of Israel, not one died.
9:7	And Pharaoh sent and, behold, not even one had died of the cattle of Israel; and Pharaoh's heart was hardened and he did not send out the people.
9:8	And the L rd said to Moses and to Aaron: Take for yourselves your full handfuls of furnace-soot, and let Moses fling it heavenwards before the eyes of Pharaoh.
9:9	And it shall be dust over all the land of Egypt. And it will be upon man and beast, boils sprouting blisters in all the land of Egypt.
9:10	And they took the furnace-soot and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses flung it heavenwards, and it became blister-sprouting boils in man and beast [(those beasts which the G d-fearing among the Egyptians had taken into their houses during the pestilence (compare 20), only those in the field dying (3)].
9:11	And the necromancers could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were in the necromancers and in all of Egypt.
9:12	And the L rd strengthened Pharaoh's heart and he did not heed them, as the L rd had said to Moses.
9:13	And the L rd said to Moses: Rise early in the morning and appear before Pharaoh, and say to him: Thus said the L rd, the G d of the Hebrews: Send out My people and let them serve Me.
9:14	For this time I am sending all of My plagues against your heart and in your servants and in your people, so that you know that there is none like Me in the whole land.
9:15	For now [in the plague of pestilence] I could have stretched forth My hand and smitten you and your people with pestilence, and you would have gone lost from the earth.
9:16	But, because of this I have preserved you, in order to show you My might, and that My name be spoken in all the land.
9:17	You still tread My people down, not letting them go.
9:18	Behold, I shall rain down as at this time tomorrow [(when the sun reaches this mark that I have inscribed on the wall)] a very sore hail, the like of which has not been in Egypt from the day of its founding until now.
9:19	And now, send, gather in your cattle and everything you have in the field. Every man and beast found in the field which will not be taken into the house — the hail will descend upon them and they will die.
9:20	Those who feared the word of the L rd among the servants of Pharaoh drove their servants and their cattle into the houses.
9:21	And whoever did not take to heart the word of the L rd left his servants and his cattle in the field.
9:22	And the L rd said to Moses: Stretch your hand towards the heavens and there will be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man and on beast, and on all the grass in the field in the land of Egypt.
9:23	And Moses stretched his staff towards the heavens, and the L rd sent thunders and hail, and fire coursed to the ground, and the L rd rained hail on the land of Egypt.
9:24	And there was hail, and fire flaming within the hail, extremely sore, the like of which had not been in the land of Egypt since it had become a nation.
9:25	And the hail smote in all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, from man until beast. And the hail smote all the grass in the field and broke all the trees in the field.
9:26	Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.
9:27	And Pharaoh sent and he called to Moses and to Aaron, and he said to them: I have sinned this time. The L rd is the righteous one and I and my people are the wicked ones.
9:28	Entreat the L rd, and enough of thunders of G d and hail! And I will send you and you will be detained no longer.
9:29	And Moses said to him: When I leave the city [(which was full of idolatry)], I shall spread out my hands to the L rd. The thunders will stop and there will be no more hail, so that you will know that the earth is the L rd's.
9:30	But you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the L rd G d [and that you will revert to your perverseness with the cessation of the hail.]
9:31	And the flax and the barley were broken [by the hail], for the barley was ripe [and hard] and the flax was in stalk.
9:32	But the wheat and the spelt were not broken, for they were late growths [and, therefore, soft].
9:33	And Moses went away from Pharaoh out of the city, and he spread out his hands to the L rd, and the thunders stopped and the hail, and rain did not reach the ground.
9:34	And Pharaoh saw that the rain stopped, and the hail and the thunders, and he continued to sin; and he hardened his heart, he and his servants.
9:35	And Pharaoh's heart was strengthened and he did not send out the children of Israel, as the L rd had spoken by the hand of Moses.

10:1	And the L rd said to Moses: Come to Pharaoh [and warn him], for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants in order to set these signs in his midst.
10:2	And so that you tell in the ears of your son and the son of your son, of My setting Egypt to scorn and of My signs that I placed in them, and you will know that I am the L rd.
10:3	And Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh and they said to him: Thus said the L rd, the G d of the Hebrews: How long will you refuse to be humbled before Me? Send out My people and let them serve Me.
10:4	For if you refuse to send out My people, tomorrow I shall bring a locust swarm in your boundaries.
10:5	And it will cover the face of the land so that the land cannot be seen, and it will devour the remainder of the remnant left to you from the hail. And it will devour every tree that sprouts for you from the ground.
10:6	And they will fill your houses, and the houses of all of your servants, and the houses of all of Egypt, which your fathers have not seen, and the fathers of your fathers, from the day they were upon the ground until this day. And he turned and went out from before Pharaoh.
10:7	And the servants of Pharaoh said to him: How long will this one be a stumbling block to us? Sent out the people and let them serve the L rd their G d. Do you not yet know that Egypt is lost?
10:8	And Moses and Aaron were returned [by messenger] to Pharaoh. And he said to them: Go serve the L rd your G d. Who and who are the goers?
10:9	And Moses said: With our youth and with our elders will we go; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go. For it is a feast of the L rd to us.
10:10	And he said to them: May the L rd thus be with you as I will send you and your children. [How much more so will I not send your flocks and herds!] See, that [your intended] evil will turn against you.
10:11	Not so, [as you say, to take the children with you, but], let the men now go and serve the L rd, for that [to sacrifice to the L rd (3:18, 5:3)] is what you ask. And he [(It is not indicated who)] drove them away from Pharaoh's presence.
10:12	And the L rd said to Moses: Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locust swarm. And it shall come up upon the land of Egypt and it shall devour all the grass in the land, all that was left by the hail.
10:13	And Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the L rd swept an east wind over the land all that day and all that night. Morning came and the east wind bore the locust swarm, [Egypt being in the south-west of Eretz Yisrael].
10:14	And the locust swarm came up on all the land of Egypt, and it rested in the entire boundary of Egypt — very sore. Before it there had never been a locust swarm of its like, and after it there will not be such.
10:15	And it covered the face of the whole land and the land was darkened, and it devoured all the grass of the earth and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. And there remained no green on a tree or in the grass of the field in all the land of Egypt.
10:16	And Pharaoh hastened to call Moses and Aaron, and he said: I have sinned to the L rd your G d and to you.
10:17	And now, forgive my sin, I pray you, just this time, and entreat the L rd your G d that He remove from me just this death.
10:18	And Moses went out from before Pharaoh and he prayed to the L rd.
10:19	And the L rd turned a very strong west wind, and it lifted the locust swarm and cast it into the Red Sea. There remained not one locust [(even of those they had salted)] in all the border of Egypt.
10:20	And the L rd strengthened Pharaoh's heart and he did not send out the children of Israel.
10:21	And the L rd said to Moses: Stretch forth your hand towards the heavens, and there will be darkness over the land of Egypt, which shall darken darkness.
10:22	And Moses stretched forth his hand towards the heavens, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt a triad of days.
10:23	One man did not see another [for one triad of days (when the wicked among the Jews who refused to leave Egypt were killed — in darkness, so the Egyptians could not say: "These are being smitten as we are")], and no man rose from his place [(One who was sitting could not stand, and one who was standing could not sit)] for [another] triad of days [(when the Jews could search their houses at will for vessels to take with them during the exodus)], and for all the children of Israel there was light in their habitations.
10:24	And Pharaoh called to Moses and he said: Go serve the L rd; only your flocks and herds leave in place. Also your children shall go with you.
10:25	And Moses said: [Not only shall our cattle go with us, but] you, too, shall place in our hands sacrifices and burnt-offerings, and we shall offer them to the L rd our G d.
10:26	Our cattle, too, shall go with us; a hoof will not remain. For we will take thereof to serve the L rd our G d. For we do not know what [i.e., how much we will need] to serve the L rd until we come there.
10:27	And the L rd strengthened Pharaoh's heart and he did not want to send them.
10:28	And Pharaoh said to him: Go from me. Take heed to yourself. Do not see my face again. For on the day you see my face you will die.
10:29	And Moses said: True have you spoken, [and in the proper time. Indeed,] I shall not see your face again!
11
11:1	And the L rd said to Moses: Yet one more plague shall I bring upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt. After that, he shall send you hence. When he sends (you), [he shall send] all [of you]; he shall drive you hence.
11:2	Speak, I pray you, in the ears of the people, that every man ask of his (Egyptian) neighbor and every woman ask of her neighbor vessels of silver and vessels of gold, [so that the righteous one, Abraham, not say "and they shall serve them and they shall afflict them" (Genesis 15:3) He did fulfill, but "and afterwards they shall go out with great wealth" (Ibid. 14) He did not fulfill.]
11:3	And the L rd put the favor of the people in the eyes of Egypt. The man Moses, too, was very great in the land of Egypt in the eyes of the servants of Pharaoh and in the eyes of the people.
11:4	And Moses said [to Pharaoh]: Thus said the L rd: When the night is divided [i.e., at midnight] I shall go out into the midst of Egypt.
11:5	And every first-born in the land of Egypt will die, from the first-born of Pharaoh who sits on his throne [(and down)] until the first-born of the maidservant behind the mill-stones [(and up. The captive first-born (see 12:29) died so that they not say that their gods "claimed their shame" and brought destruction upon the Egyptians. The sons of the maidservants died, for they, too, worked the Jews and rejoiced in their affliction)] and all the first-born of beasts, [these having been served as objects of idolatry. ("When the Holy One Blessed be He exacts punishment of a nation, He exacts punishment of its gods.")]
11:6	And there will be a great outcry in the whole land of Egypt, the like of which had never been and the like of which will not be again.
11:7	And against all the children of Israel a dog shall not sharpen its tongue — from man until beast — so that you will know that the L rd distinguished between Egypt and Israel.
11:8	And all these servants of yours will come down and bow down to me, saying: Go out! you and all your followers; and then I will go out. And [after he finished what he had to say] he went out from before Pharaoh in great wrath [over his having said (10:28): "You shall not see my face again!"]
11:9	And the L rd said to Moses: Pharaoh will not pay heed to you, so that My wonders be multiplied in the land of Egypt [viz.: the plague of the first-born, the splitting of the Red Sea, and the "shaking out" of the Egyptians therein.]
11:10	And Moses and Aaron performed all of these wonders before Pharaoh, and the L rd strengthened Pharaoh's heart and he did not send the children of Israel from his land.
12
12:1	And the L rd said to Moses and to Aaron [(Aaron being accorded honor in this first mitzvah (2) for having participated and exerted himself along with Moses in the embassy of the signs)] in the land of Egypt [outside the city (see 11:29)], saying:
12:2	This month [this stage of the moon (the L rd "pointing it out" to Moses)] [Nissan] shall be to you the beginning of months. It is the first for you of the months of the year.
12:3	Speak [today, on Rosh Chodesh] to the whole congregation of Israel, saying: On the tenth day of this month [(the "taking" of the paschal lamb of Egypt was on the tenth, but not that of future generations)] shall they take for themselves, each man a lamb for a family [(and, in the event that the family is large and one lamb will not suffice for it)], a lamb for a household [(i.e., for each household within that family)].
12:4	And if the household is too small for one lamb [so that some of it would be left over (nothar, which is forbidden)], then he and his neighbor next to his house shall take it according to the count of souls. Each according to his eating [(excluding one who is so sick or old that he cannot eat at least an olive size)] shall you [include in the] count for the lamb.
12:5	A lamb, unblemished, a one-year-old male [i.e., in its first year] shall it be to you. Of the lambs or of the goats shall you take it, [a (young) goat, too, being regarded as a "lamb"].
12:6	And it shall be to you for a keeping [i.e., surveillance against blemish] until the fourteenth day of this month [(Israel being given two mitzvoth on that night — the blood of the paschal lamb and the blood of circumcision — to make them worthy of redemption)], and the entire congregation of Israel shall slaughter it [(whence it is derived that one's messenger is reckoned as the sender himself)], from midday (on).
12:7	And they shall take from the blood [in the basin] and place it on the two side posts and on the lintel of the houses where they shall eat it, [but not on non-dwellings].
12:8	And they shall eat the flesh, [but not sinews and bones] on this night, roasted in fire. And matzoth with merorim [(Every bitter herb is called maror)] shall they eat it, [in commemoration of (1:10): "And they embittered (vayemararu) their lives."]
12:9	Do not eat of it not entirely roasted or cooked in water [or any other liquid], but roasted in fire [(a negative commandment here being added to the positive (8)]; [it is to be roasted entire], its head, with its legs, with its inner parts, [and its entrails placed therein after rinsing].
12:10	And you shall not leave over anything of it until the morning [(sunrise)]; and what is left over of it until morning [(dawn)], in fire shall you burn it.
12:11	And thus shall you eat it: your thighs girded ["ready for the road"], your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand. And you shall eat it in haste — it is a pesach ("skipping over") offering to the L rd [see 27].
12:12	And I shall pass through the land of Egypt in this night, and I shall smite every first-born in the land of Egypt [(even first-born of other nations in the land of Egypt)], from man until beast; and upon all the gods of Egypt I shall wreak judgments, [wooden idols rotting and metal ones melting]; I am the L rd [I shall do this Myself and not through a messenger.]
12:13	And the blood shall be for you as a sign [("for you" and not for others" — whence it is inferred that the blood was placed on the inside)] upon the houses where you are, and I shall see the blood [i.e., I shall "give heart" to your performance of My mitzvoth], and I shall skip over you, and there will be no destroying plague in you when I smite the land of Egypt [(even if you are found in an Egyptian house — but there will be plague in an Egyptian found in an Israelite house)].
12:14	And this day [of the exodus] shall be for you as a remembrance [for the coming generations], and you shall celebrate it [the fifteenth of Nissan] as a festival of the L rd. For your generations as an everlasting statute shall you celebrate it.
12:15	Seven days [lit., "a septet of days"] shall you eat matzoth. [(Eating matzoth on the first night is obligatory, and, thereafter, optional)] But on the first day [i.e., on the eve of Pesach] you shall eliminate leaven from your houses. For whoever eats chametz, that soul [(one who has volition, but not one who is forced)] shall be cut off from Israel [and from My presence] — from the first day until the seventh day.
12:16	And on the first day a calling of holiness and on the seventh day a calling of holiness shall there be unto you. [Call it "holy" for purposes of eating, drinking, and raiment.] No labor shall be done in them [even through a non-Jew]. Only what is to be eaten by all souls, that [labor] alone may be done for you, [and not any preparatory labor which could have been done before the festival].
12:17	And you shall watch over the matzoth [that they not become chametz]; for on this very same day I took your hosts out from the land of Egypt. And you shall guard this day [against performing labor thereon] unto your generations as an everlasting statute.
12:18	On the first day, on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening shall you eat matzoth, until the twenty-first day of the month in the evening [(whence it is derived that the mitzvah obtains in the evenings, too)].
12:19	Seven days, se'or [a leavening agent] shall not be found in your houses [i.e., under your control — to exclude liability for chametz of a non-Jew which is found in a Jew's property.] For whoever eats leavening, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a proselyte [(for whom the miracle was not performed)] or a citizen of the land.
12:20	All leavening [(including an admixture — this is the exhortation against the eating of se'or)] you shall not eat. In all of your habitations shall you eat matzoth [(to exclude — as satisfying the mitzvah— matzoth of ma'aser sheni and thanksgiving challoth, which may be eaten only in Jerusalem)].
12:21	And Moses called to all the elders of Israel, and he said to them: Draw forth [if you have your own,] and take unto yourselves [i.e., buy, if you do not have your own,] sheep for your families [a lamb for a family], and slaughter the pesach.
12:22	And you shall take a bundle [three stalks] of hyssop and dip it in the blood which is in the basin, and touch the lintel and the two doorposts (with some) of the blood which is in the basin, [a new dipping for each touching]; and you, do not go out, a man from the door of his house until morning. ["Once 'the destroyer' has been granted leave to destroy, he does not distinguish between righteous and wicked."]
12:23	And the L rd will pass through to smite Egypt, and He will see the blood on the lintel and on the two door posts, and the L rd will skip over the door, and He will not permit the destroyer to come to your houses to smite.
12:24	And you shall keep this thing as a statute for you and for your children forever.
12:25	And it shall be, when you come to the land that the L rd will give you, as He has spoken [6:8], then you shall observe this service. [The service is contingent upon their entering the land. (In the desert they were obliged to observe only one Pesach, in the second year, by Divine command.)]
12:26	And it shall be, if your sons say to you: "What is this service to you?" [an allusion to the question of "the wicked son" (see 13:8)],
12:27	then you shall say: It is a paschal sacrifice to the L rd, who skipped over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when He smote Egypt, and our houses He saved. And the people bowed down and they prostrated themselves [for the tidings of deliverance and entry to the land and for the tidings of the children that would be born to them,]
12:28	And the children of Israel went and they did [(their intent to do being regarded as doing, and their going being rewarded as well as their doing)] as the L rd commanded Moses and Aaron, [exactly, leaving nothing undone.] So did they [Moses and Aaron also] do.
12:29	And it was in the middle of the night, and the L rd [He and His "tribunal"] smote every first-born [even a non-Egyptian] in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh sitting on his throne until the captive first-born in the dungeon [see 11:5 (The first-born of the maid-servant is subsumed in "until the captive first-born")], and every first-born of the beast.
12:30	And Pharaoh arose [from his bed] at night [and not in the third hour of the morning in the manner of kings], he and all his servants [(Pharaoh awakened them)] and all of Egypt. And there was a great outcry in Egypt, for there was no house where no one had died. [If there were no first-born there, the eldest in the house died.]
12:31	And he called to Moses and to Aaron at night, and he said: Arise, go out from the midst of my people, both you [the adults] and the children of Israel [the children], and go serve the L rd as you have spoken [and not as I have spoken].
12:32	Also your flocks and also your herds take, as you have spoken [i.e., Take also of mine as you have spoken (10:25): "You, too, etc"], and go and bless also me [Pray for me that I not die, for I, too, am a first-born.]
12:33	And Egypt bore down upon the people, hastening to send them out of the land, for they said: We are all dead, [even non first-born dying, beyond the decree of Moses].
12:34	And the people took their dough before it leavened, [the Egyptians pressing them to leave], their [matzoh and maror] remnants bound up in their clothes, on their shoulders [and not upon their beasts, in the love of the mitzvah].
12:35	And the children of Israel did as Moses had bid them [11:2] and they asked of Egypt vessels of silver and vessels of gold and raiment.
12:36	And the L rd placed the favor of the people in the eyes of Egypt, and they lent them [even more than they asked], and they emptied out Egypt.
12:37	And the children of Israel journeyed from Ramses to Succoth [a distance of one hundred and twenty miles, "on eagle's wings" (19:4)], six hundred thousand men on foot, aside from the children.
12:38	And also a great mixture [of proselytes] went up with them. And flocks and herds, a great crush of cattle.
12:39	And they baked the dough which they had taken out of Egypt, cakes of matzoh, for it had not leavened. For they were driven out of Egypt and they could not tarry; and provisions, too, they could not make for themselves [(a tribute to Israel's belief in the L rd, venturing forth into the desert without provisions)].
12:40	And the habitation of the children of Israel in the land of Egypt [and their habitations outside it after "Your seed shall be a stranger, etc." (Genesis 15:13)] was [all together] four hundred and thirty years.
12:41	And it was at the end of four hundred and thirty years, and it was on this very same day [the fifteenth of Nissan, (the date of the angels' tidings to Abraham on the birth of a son, the date of Isaac's birth, the date of the covenant between the pieces — the L rd not delaying an instant after the arrival of the foretold time)] that all the hosts of the L rd went out of the land of Egypt.
12:42	It is a night of guarding for the L rd, ["guarded" by the L rd] to take them out from the land of Egypt; it is "this night" of the L rd [i.e., of His saying to Abraham: "On this night I shall redeem your children"], guarded [against destructive agents] for all the children of Israel for (all) their generations [see 33].
12:43	And the L rd said to Moses and Aaron [(on the fourteenth of Nissan)]: This is the statute of the paschal offering: No stranger [(Both a heretical Jew and a non-Jew are implied)] may eat of it.
12:44	And every man-servant acquired by money — you shall circumcise him; then shall he [(according to one view, the master; according to another, the servant)] eat of it.
12:45	A sojourner [a ger toshav (one who does not convert fully, but who undertakes not to serve idols and to observe the seven Noahide laws)] and a hired man [a non-Jew] may not eat of it. [The above applies (even) to a circumcised Arab or a circumcised Giveonite who is a sojourner or a hired man.]
12:46	In one house [i.e., group] shall it be eaten. Do not take from the house [i.e., from the group] of the flesh outside. And a bone [which has an olive-size of meat on it] shall you not break in it.
12:47	The entire congregation of Israel [in any groups] shall offer it [in future generations, (as opposed to the Pesach of Egypt, when it was offered by family groups)].
12:48	And if there live with you a stranger (i.e., a proselyte) and he would offer a paschal offering to the L rd [on the fourteenth of Nissan], let all of his males be circumcised and then he shall draw near to offer it. And he shall be as the citizen of the land, and no uncircumcised one shall eat of it [(including one who is not circumcised because his brothers have died as a result of circumcision)].
12:49	One Torah shall there be for the citizen and for the stranger that lives in your midst. [The proselyte is hereby equated with the citizen for all of the other mitzvoth of the Torah.]
12:50	And all the children of Israel did as the L rd commanded Moses and Aaron; thus did they do.
12:51	And it was in this very same day that the L rd took the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.
13
13:1	And the L rd said to Moses, saying:
13:2	Sanctify unto Me every first-born, the [first] opener of each womb among the children of Israel in man and beast; he is Mine, [acquired by Me when I smote the first-born of Egypt].
13:3	And Moses said to the people: Remember this day when you went out of Egypt from the house of bondage [(We are hereby taught to make mention of the exodus every day)]. For with might of hand did the L rd take you hence, and chametz shall not be eaten.
13:4	This day you go out, in the month of spring [an equable month: neither hot, nor cold, nor rainy.]
13:5	And it shall be, when the L rd brings you to the land of Canaan [(a particular nation of the seven nations generically called "Canaanites")], the Chitti, the Emori, the Chivi, and the Yevussi, which He swore to your forefathers to give to you [(Abraham — Genesis 15:18; Isaac — 26:3; Jacob — 28:13)], a land flowing with milk [from goats] and honey [from dates and figs], then you shall perform this service [of Pesach] on this month.
13:6	Seven days shall you eat matzoth, and on the seventh day, a festival to the L rd.
13:7	Matzoth shall be eaten the seven days; and chametz (leaven) shall not be seen unto you, and se'or (leavening) shall not be seen unto you in all of your boundaries.
13:8	And you shall tell [vehigadeta] your son [(an allusion to "the son who does not know how to ask." "Open for him" with words of aggadah (narration), which stimulate questioning)] on that day, saying: Because of this [i.e., so that I fulfill His mitzvoth, e.g., pesach, matzoth, and maror] the L rd wrought for me when I went out of Egypt [(an allusion to the answer to "the wicked son," (see 12:26), viz.: "The L rd wrought for me and not for you. Had you been there, you would not have merited redemption.")]
13:9	And it [the account of the exodus from Egypt] shall be to you as a sign upon your [left] hand [in the hand phylactery] and as a memorial between your eyes [in the head phylactery], so that the Torah of the L rd be in your mouth; for with a mighty hand did the L rd take you out of Egypt.
13:10	And you shall keep this statute in its time, from year to year.
13:11	And it shall be, when the L rd brings you to the land of the Canaanite as He swore to you [6:8] and to your forefathers and gives it to you [(Let it be in your eyes as if it is given to you on that day and not as an inheritance from your fathers)],
13:12	then you shall set apart every firstling of the womb for the L rd. And every firstling of the cast-off [i.e., the premature birth] of a beast that shall be to you, the males are the L rd's.
13:13	And every firstling of an ass [and not of any other unclean beast, the first-born of the Egyptians being compared to asses, and, also, because the asses "assisted" Israel in taking out the spoils of Egypt)] shall you redeem with a lamb. [The lamb is given to the Cohein, benefit may then be derived from the firstling, and the lamb is chullin (non-sacred) for the Cohein.] And if you do not redeem it, then you shall break its neck [with a hatchet from behind (He caused the Cohein a loss; therefore, he suffers a loss)], and every human first-born among your sons shall you redeem [by giving five selaim to the Cohein].
13:14	And it shall be, if your son asks you in after time, saying "What is this?" [(an allusion to the question of "the simple son")], then you shall say to him: With might of hand did the L rd take us out of Egypt from the house of bondage.
13:15	And it was, when Pharaoh resisted sending us out, that the L rd killed every first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of man until the first-born of beast. Therefore, I sacrifice to the L rd every male firstling of the womb, and every firstling of my sons, I redeem.
13:16	And it shall be as a sign upon your hand and as a frontlet [totafoth (signifying "four" — the four compartments of the head phylactery)] between your eyes; for with might of hand did the L rd take us out of Egypt.
Beshalach
13:17	And it was, when Pharaoh sent out the people, that G d did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, for it was near [and afforded "easy return" to Egypt]. For G d said: Lest the people bethink themselves [about having left Egypt] when they see war [e.g., Numbers 14:45] and they return to Egypt.
13:18	And G d led the people circuitously by way of the desert to the Red Sea. And the children of Israel went up armed from the land of Egypt.
13:19	And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him. For he had made the children of Israel swear, saying: G d will surely remember you, and you shall bring up my bones from here with you, [the tribes, (the bones of all the tribes also being brought up with them)].
13:20	And they journeyed from Succoth [on the second day] and they encamped in Etham at the edge of the desert.
13:21	And the L rd went before them by day with [i.e., leading] a pillar of cloud to guide them on the way, and at night, with a pillar of fire to light them, to go by day and by night.
13:22	He did not dispel the pillar of cloud in the day and the pillar of light at night before the people. [Before the one "set," the other rose.]
14
14:1	And the L rd said to Moses, saying:
14:2	Speak to the children of Israel that they return [The L rd turned them back to Egypt to deceive Pharaoh into thinking they had lost their way (3)] and encamp before Pi Hachiroth [Pithom, called "Pi Hachiroth" because the Jews became freemen (bnei chorin) there], between Migdol and the sea, before Baal Tzefon [the only remaining Egyptian idol (left over to deceive the Egyptians into relying on its potency)]. Over against it shall you encamp by the sea.
14:3	And Pharaoh will say about the children of Israel: They are trapped in the land; the desert has shut them in.
14:4	And I shall strengthen Pharaoh's heart and he will pursue them, and I will be honored through [the downfall of] Pharaoh and all of his host [(Pharaoh being mentioned first in that he was the "initiator")], and Egypt will know that I am the L rd. And they did so. [(a tribute to Israel, who did not ask: "How can we turn back towards our pursuers!")]
14:5	And it was told to the king of Egypt [on the fourth day, by officers that he had sent with them (after seeing that they did not return to Egypt on the stipulated third day)] that the people had fled. [(On the fifth and sixth days they pursued them; on the night of the seventh Israel went down to the sea; and in the morning — the seventh day of Pesach — they sang (15:1)], and the heart of Pharaoh (12:31) and of his servants (10:7) was reversed against the people. [Now they pursued them for the wealth that they had lent them], and they said: What is this that we did in sending Israel away from serving us!
14:6	And he [Pharaoh himself] harnessed his chariot, and he "took" [by suasion] his people with him.
14:7	And he took six hundred choice chariots and all [the other] chariots of Egypt, and officers upon all of them.
14:8	And the L rd strengthened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt [Pharaoh wavering between pursuing and not pursuing] and he pursued the children of Israel, and the children of Israel went out with a high hand [i.e., with manifest might].
14:9	And Egypt pursued them, and they overtook them camping by the sea, every horse of Pharaoh's chariots and his horsemen and his host, by Pi Hachiroth, before Baal Tzefon.
14:10	And Pharaoh pressed ahead [of the others], and the children of Israel lifted their eyes, and, behold, Egypt coming after them [with one heart, as one man], and they were exceedingly afraid, and the children of Israel cried out to the L rd, ["embracing the trade" (prayer) of their fathers: (Abraham — Genesis 19:27; Isaac — 24:63; Jacob — 28:11)].
14:11	And they said to Moses: Is it for lack of graves in Egypt that you have taken us to die in the desert! What is this that you did to us to take us out of Egypt.
14:12	Is not this the thing that we spoke to you in Egypt [5:21], saying: Let us be and let us serve Egypt, for it is better for us to serve Egypt than to die in the desert.
14:13	And Moses said to the people: Do not fear. Stand ready to see the salvation of the L rd, which He shall work for you this day. For your seeing Egypt is [only] this day; you shall see them no more, forever.
14:14	The L rd will war for you, and you will be still.
14:15	And the L rd said to Moses: Why do you cry out to Me? [i.e., Why do you prolong your prayer when Israel are stepped in affliction?] Speak to the children of Israel and have them go forward [(There is nothing standing in their way. The merits of their fathers and their belief in Me will suffice to split the sea.)]
14:16	And you, raise your staff, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and split it. And the children of Israel shall come in the midst of the sea on the dry land.
14:17	And I, behold, I shall strengthen the heart of Egypt, and they shall come after them, and I shall be glorified through Pharaoh and through all his host, through his chariots and through his horsemen.
14:18	And Egypt will know that I am the L rd when I am glorified through Pharaoh, through his chariots and through his horsemen.
14:19	And the angel of G d (Elokim), who went before the camp of Israel, turned and went behind them [to separate the Israelites from the Egyptians and to receive the projectiles intended for them. ("Elokim" connotes justice. Israel was being judged at that moment for survival or for destruction along with the Egyptians)]. And [when it became dark and the pillar of fire supervened], the pillar of cloud turned from before them and stood behind them [to "darken things" for the Egyptians].
14:20	And it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. And there was a cloud and darkness [for the Egyptians] and it [the pillar of fire] lighted the night [for the Israelites], and the one [camp] did not come close to the other all the night.
14:21	And Moses stretched his hand over the sea, and the L rd drove the sea with a strong east wind [(the strongest of the winds)] all the night, and He made the sea into dry land, and the waters [of all the world] were split.
14:22	And the children of Israel came in the midst of the sea on the dry land. And the water was to them a wall, on their right and on their left.
14:23	And Egypt pursued and came behind them, all horse of Pharaoh [i.e., all of his horses being regarded as (only) one in the eyes of the L rd], his chariot and his riders into the midst of the sea.
14:24	And it was in the morning watch that the L rd looked to the camp of Egypt [to destroy it] with a pillar of fire and cloud [(The pillar of cloud rendered the sea-bed clay, and the pillar of fire made it so hot that the horses' hooves fell off)], and He confounded the camp of Egypt.
14:25	And He removed their chariot wheels [(They were burnt off, the chariots jolted, and the drivers were broken)], and He led them with [the measure of] hardness, [measure for measure for their hardness (9:34)]. And Egypt said: I shall flee from before Israel; for the L rd wars for them against the Egyptians.
14:26	And the L rd said to Moses: Stretch forth your hand over the sea so that the waters [standing like a wall] return [to their place] upon Egypt, upon its chariot, and upon its riders.
14:27	And Moses stretched forth his hand upon the sea, and the sea returned towards morning to its [original] strength, and Egypt [in distraction] fled towards it, and the L rd shook out Egypt into the midst of the sea.
14:28	And the waters returned and covered the chariot and the riders of all the host of Pharaoh that came after them in the sea; not so much as one remained of them.
14:29	And the children of Israel walked on the dry land in the midst of the sea. And the water was to them a wall, on their right and on their left.
14:30	And the L rd saved Israel on that day from the hand of Egypt, and Israel saw Egypt dead on the shore of the sea, [the Egyptians having been cast up there so that Israel not say: Just as we came up on this side, so they came up on another side and will pursue us].
14:31	And Israel saw the great hand by which the L rd wrought against Egypt, and the people feared the L rd, and they believed in the L rd and in Moses, His servant.
15
15:1	Then Moses and the children of Israel would sing [i.e., it entered their heart to sing] this song to the L rd, and they said: I shall sing to the L rd for He is exalted [over all the] exalted: horse and its rider [joined together] He cast into the sea.
15:2	The strength and vengeance of the L rd has been salvation to me. This is my G d [(His glory was so manifest that they pointed to it)] and I will extol Him; the G d of my father [(Not I, but my forefathers are the origin of this hallowing)], and I will exalt Him.
15:3	The L rd is the Master of war; the L rd is His name [his "weapon," with which He wages war].
15:4	The chariots of Pharaoh and his host He cast into the sea, and the élite of his officers were mired in the Red Sea, [the sea-bed turning into slime, measure for measure for their belaboring Israel with lime and bricks.]
15:5	[He mired them there] so that the waters should [return and] cover them; they dropped to the depths like stone.
15:6	Your right hand, O L rd, is grand in power. Your right hand, O L rd, breaks the foe.
15:7	And [if Your right hand, alone, breaks the foe, then, when it is uplifted] in the greatness of Your grandeur, [how much more so do] You destroy those who rise up against You [i.e., those who rise up against Israel. And, if in the greatness of Your grandeur alone, they are destroyed, then,] when You send forth Your wrath, [how much more so] does it consume them as stubble!
15:8	And with the breath of Your nostrils [i.e., in the heat of Your anger], the waters were [heated solid and] piled up. the waves stood up as a wall. The depths were congealed [into stone, and the Egyptians were dashed against it] in the fury of the sea.
15:9	The foe (i.e., Pharaoh) said [to his people in urging them to pursue Israel:] I shall pursue, I shall overtake, I shall divide (the) spoil [with my officers and servants]. My spirit [i.e., my desire] will be filled with them. I shall draw forth my sword; my hand will impoverish them.
15:10	You blew with Your breath — the sea covered them; they plummeted like lead in the mighty waters.
15:11	Who is like You among the mighty, O L rd? Who is like You, majestic in holiness, dreaded in praise [i.e., men dreading to praise You lest they fall short in Your praises], doing wonders!
15:12	You inclined Your right hand [and they fell — all being contained in Your hand] — the earth swallowed them up [(whence it is derived that they merited burial for vindicating G d's judgment upon them)].
15:13	You have led forth in Your kindness this people whom You have redeemed. You have guided them in Your strength to Your holy habitation.
15:14	Peoples heard — they tremble; quaking has seized the inhabitants of Plasheth [(for having killed the sons of Ephraim, who "pushed" the redemption prematurely and were killed by the inhabitants of Gath (I Chronicles 7:21)].
15:15	Then the chiefs of Edom were confounded; the mighty ones of Moav were seized with trembling. [Even though they were not the "target," they were mortified by Israel's ascendancy]; all the inhabitants of Canaan melted [in fear of destruction and conquest].
15:16	There fell upon them dread [(upon the distant — see Joshua 2:9-10)] and terror [(upon the near)]; by the greatness of Your arm they will be (struck) still as stone. Until Your people, O L rd, pass over [the Arnon]; until there pass over [the Jordan] this people, O L rd, whom You have acquired [endearingly] (to Yourself).
15:17	You will bring them and You will plant them [("them" and not "us" — Moses prophesying in effect that he himself would not enter the land)] in the mountain of Your inheritance, aligned with Your habitation [the Throne of Glory], which You have made, O L rd — the sanctuary, O L rd, which Your [two] hands have established [(the sanctuary being more beloved of the L rd than the world, which He created with one hand (Psalms 48:13). And when will it be rebuilt with two hands? At that time when… (18)]
15:18	the L rd will reign for ever and ever.
15:19	When the horse of Pharaoh came with its chariot and its riders into the sea, and the L rd turned back upon them the waters of the sea, and the children of Israel walked on the dry land in the midst of the sea —
15:20	Then Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron [(Miriam having prophesied the birth of Moses, etc., while she was only the sister of Aaron)] took the timbrel in her hand [(the righteous women of that generation having taken timbrels out of Egypt in their certitude that G d would work miracles for Israel)], and all the women went out after her with timbrels and dances.
15:21	And Miriam answered to them [(Moses chanted to the men, and they responded after him, and Miriam chanted to the women (1):] "Sing to the L rd, for He is exalted [over all the] exalted; horse and its rider He cast into the sea."
15:22	And Moses made Israel journey from the Red Sea [against their wills (the Egyptians having adorned their horses with gold, silver, and precious stones, which the Israelites lingered to collect, "the spoils of the sea" exceeding the spoils of Egypt)], and Israel went out to the desert of Shur, and they traveled three days in the desert without finding any water.
15:23	And they came to Marah, and they could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter (marim) — wherefore it is called Marah.
15:24	And the people caviled against Moses, saying: "What shall we drink!"
15:25	And he cried out to the L rd, and the L rd showed him a tree; and he cast it into the waters and the waters were sweetened. There He made for them statute and judgment [(He gave them for study some of the areas of Torah — Sabbath, the red heifer, jurisdiction)], and there He tried them [(and "discovered" their stiff-neckedness, their not imploring Moses, but caviling against him)].
15:26	And He said: If you pay heed to the voice of the L rd your G d, [taking upon yourselves to perform the mitzvoth], and you do what is just in His eyes, [performing them], and you give ear to His mitzvoth, [being attentive to their details], and you keep all of His statutes, [decrees having no ostensible reason, and, therefore, "vulnerable to attack" by the evil inclination (e.g., the prohibitions against wearing kilaim and eating swine, the institution of the red heifer, and the like)] — then [if you observe My mitzvoth], all of the illness which I placed upon Egypt I will not place upon you, for I am the L rd who heals you [by "prescribing" (Torah and mitzvoth) against this illness].
15:27	And they came to Eilim, and there (they found) twelve springs of water, [for each of the twelve tribes], and seventy palm trees, [for each of the seventy elders], and they encamped there by the waters.
16
16:1	And they journeyed from Eilim, and the entire congregation of the children of Israel came to the desert of Sin between Eilim and Sinai on the fifteenth day of the second month of their going out from the land of Egypt [(whence we derive that of the left-over dough they ate sixty-one meals, and the manna descended for them on the sixteenth of Iyyar)].
16:2	And the entire congregation of the children of Israel caviled against Moses and Aaron in the desert [because their bread had ended].
16:3	And the children of Israel said to them: Would that we had died by the hand of the L rd in the land of Egypt, when we sat over the fleshpot, when we ate bread to satiety! For you have taken us out to this desert to kill this entire congregation by famine!
16:4	And the L rd said to Moses: Behold, I shall rain down bread for you from heaven, and the people shall go out and gather each day's ration in its day, [and not one day for another], so that I may try them, whether or not they will walk in My law [(not to leave over of it until morning and not to go out to gather on Shabbath)].
16:5	And it shall be, on the sixth day, that they shall prepare what they shall bring, and it shall be [after they have gathered it] double [(for Friday and Shabbath)] what they gather every day.
16:6	And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel: In the evening [when He sends out the quail], you will know that the L rd [and not we (3)] took you out of the land of Egypt.
16:7	And in the morning [when you receive the manna], you will see the glory [i.e., the beneficence] of the L rd, [the manna being given with a "radiant countenance" (the request for bread being "legitimate") as opposed to the quail, which was given "grudgingly"], for He hears your cavilings, [which are] against the L rd. And we, [of] what [significance] are we that you cause [(everyone) your families and your mixed multitude] to cavil against us?
16:8	And Moses said: (You will see this) when the L rd gives to you in the evening flesh to eat, and bread in the morning to satiety [(but not flesh to satiety — whence we infer that flesh is not to be eaten to satiety)], for the L rd hears your cavilings whereby you cause [others] to cavil against Him. And what are we? Not against us are your cavilings, but against the L rd.
16:9	And Moses said to Aaron: Say to the entire congregation of the children of Israel: Draw near before the L rd [to the place where the clouds will descend], for He has heard your cavilings.
16:10	And it was, as Aaron spoke to the entire congregation of the children of Israel, that they turned to the desert, and, behold, the glory of the L rd appeared in the cloud.
16:11	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
16:12	I have heard the cavilings of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying: Towards evening you will eat flesh, and in the morning you will be sated with bread; and you will know that I am the L rd your G d.
16:13	And it was in the evening that the quail arose and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew [covering the manna] around the camp, [the manna being "sandwiched" in dew (see Numbers 11:9)].
16:14	And the dew layer ascended [when the sun rose], and, behold, on the face of the desert, thin [i.e., a thin thing] was revealed [spread] thin as hoarfrost upon the ground.
16:15	And the children of Israel saw it, and each said to his neighbor: "It is man" [(a food) "preparation"], for they did not know what it was [to call it by its name.] And Moses said to them: This is the bread that the L rd has given to you to eat.
16:16	This is the thing that the L rd has commanded: Gather of it each man according to his eating, an omer [(a certain measure)] for a head [according to] the number of your souls [in your tent]; each for [the number] in his tent shall you take.
16:17	And the children of Israel did so, and they gathered, some (taking) more [than an omer for a head], some less.
16:18	[But when they came home] and they measured it in the omer (a measuring vessel of that size) [they found that] he who had taken more did not exceed [the omer] and he who had taken less did not diminish; each according to his eating had they gathered.
16:19	And Moses said to them: Let no man leave over of it until morning.
16:20	And they did not heed Moses, and men [Dathan and Aviram] left over of it until morning, and it was rotted and raised worms, and Moses was wroth with them.
16:21	And they gathered it each morning, each according to his eating; and when the sun was hot (i.e., strong), it [that which remained in the field] melted.
16:22	And it was, on the sixth day, they [found that they had] gathered double bread, two omers for [each] one. And all the princes of the congregation came and they told it to Moses [(who had not commanded them as he had been told (5), for which reason he was included in (28): "How long will you refuse to keep My mitzvoth and My laws?")]
16:23	And he said to them: This is what the L rd had spoken: A resting, a holy Sabbath is it to the L rd tomorrow. What you bake [in an oven] (of the manna)] bake [all of it today for two days], and what you would cook [in water] cook; and all the rest put by for yourselves in keeping until the morning.
16:24	And they put it by until the morning, as the L rd had commanded Moses, and it did not rot, and there was no worm in it.
16:25	[In the morning, when they were wont to go out and gather the manna, they came and asked Moses: "Shall we go out or not?"] And Moses said: Eat it [(what you have)] today. [They returned towards evening and asked: "Shall we go out now?" He answered that they should not] for it is Sabbath today to the L rd. [Seeing them to be worried that the manna might not fall again, he said:] Today you will not find it in the field, [but tomorrow you will.]
16:26	Six days you shall gather it, and on the seventh day it is Sabbath; there will not be [manna] on it, [Scripture hereby including Yom Kippur and festivals (as days on which manna does not fall)].
16:27	And it was on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather, and they did not find.
16:28	And the L rd said to Moses [("The cabbage is smitten with the thorn" — see 22)]: How long will you refuse to keep My mitzvoth and My laws?
16:29	See [with your own eyes] that the L rd has given you the Sabbath [to be observed], wherefore He gives you on the sixth day bread for two days. Let each man sit in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.
16:30	And the people rested on the seventh day.
16:31	And the children of Israel called its name "man" (see 15). And it was [round] like coriander seed and [(unlike coriander seed)] white, and its taste was like dough fried in honey.
16:32	And Moses said: This is the thing that the L rd commanded: Fill the omer with it as a keeping for your generations, so that they see the bread that I fed you in the desert when I took you out of the land of Egypt.
16:33	And Moses said to Aaron [(when the tent of meeting had been erected)]: Take one earthen jug and put therein a full omer of manna and place it before the L rd [i.e., before the ark] as a keeping for your generations.
16:34	["And Moses said, etc." (above)] as the L rd had commanded Moses. And Aaron placed it before the [ark of] testimony for a keeping.
16:35	And the children of Israel ate the manna for forty years until they came to an inhabited land [on the other side of the Jordan (see Joshua 5:11-12)]. They had eaten the manna [that had fallen on the seventh of Adar, (when Moses died, the manna ceasing with his death)], until they came to the edge of the land of Canaan [before they crossed the Jordan].
16:36	And the omer is a tenth of an ephah [forty-three and one fifth eggs (the minimum amount for the separation of challah and for meal-offerings)].
17
17:1	And the entire congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the desert of Sin in their journeys by the word of the L rd, and they encamped in Refidim; and there was no water to drink for the people.
17:2	And the people quarreled with Moses, and they said: Give us water and let us drink. And Moses said to them: Why would you quarrel with me? Why would you try the L rd [to see if He can give water in a dry land]?
17:3	And the people thirsted there for water, and the people caviled against Moses, and said: Why did you bring us up from Egypt to put to death me, my children, and my cattle by thirst?
17:4	And Moses cried out to the L rd, saying: What can I do to this people? [If I wait] but a little more they will stone me!
17:5	And the L rd said to Moses: Pass before the people [and see if they will stone you! (Why do you slander My children!)] And take with you some of the elders of Israel [to attest that you are bringing forth the waters, that they were not there before]. And your staff wherewith you smote the Nile take in your hand and go [that it not be said that it is a "punishment staff" (having been used against Pharaoh and Egypt, and that it cannot effect good)].
17:6	Behold, I shall stand before you there on the rock in Chorev, and you shall strike in the rock [into it, the staff being of hard sapphire] and water will come out of it and the people will drink. And Moses did thus before the eyes of the elders of Israel.
17:7	And he called the name of the place Massah and Merivah because of the "quarrel" (riv) of the children of Israel and because of their "proving" (nasotham) the L rd, saying: "Is the L rd in our midst or not?"
17:8	And Amalek came and warred with Israel in Refidim [(the Holy One Blessed be He saying, as it were: After everything, you have the temerity to ask if I am in your midst? I shall "sic the dog (Amalek)" upon you!)]
17:9	And Moses said to Joshua: Choose for us [you and me (whence it is derived that the honor of one's disciple should be as dear to one as his own)] men [warriors and fearers of sin, whose merits will avail them] and go out [of the cloud] and do battle with Amalek. Tomorrow I shall stand upon the top of the hill with the staff of G d in my hand.
17:10	And Joshua did as Moses said to him, to war against Amalek. And Moses, Aaron, and Chur [the son of Miriam and Calev] went up to the top of the hill [(whence it is derived that three must officiate (in prayer) on a fast day (Israel fasting at that time)].
17:11	And it was, when Moses lifted his hand, that Israel prevailed, and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. ["Now is it the hands of Moses that gain the victory!, etc." (see Rosh Hashanah 29a)]
17:12	And the hands of Moses became heavy [because he was lax in the mitzvah and deputed it to another (Joshua)], and they [Aaron and Chur] took a stone [(but not a pillow)] and placed it beneath him [(Moses associating himself with Israel's suffering)], and he sat on it. And Aaron and Chur supported his hands — one on one side, one on the other. And he was [i.e., he persisted with] his hands [spread out in an attitude of] steadfastness [in prayer] until the sun set. [The Amalekites would determine "propitious hours" for victory astrologically, and Moses caused the sun to stand still, thus confounding their reckonings.]
17:13	And Joshua weakened Amalek and his people with the sword [(He decapitated their warriors and left only the weaker ones (whence we infer that he wrought by Divine command)].
17:14	And the L rd said to Moses: Write this as a remembrance in the book [(that Amalek initiated war with Israel before all other nations], and place it in the ears of Joshua [who will bring Israel into the land, that he command Israel to give Amalek his due recompense (a hint to Moses that Joshua and not he will bring them into Eretz Yisrael)] because I desire to blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens, [for which reason I exhort you thus].
17:15	And Moses built an altar and he called its name "The L rd is my miracle."
17:16	And he said: For [the] hand [of the L rd is raised to swear] by the throne [kes (as opposed to the complete form, kissei)] of Kah (the L rd) [(as opposed to the complete name, Yod-Keh-Vav-Keh)]: "The L rd is at war with Amalek from generation to generation" [The import: G d's name will not be complete and His throne will not be complete until the name of Amalek is blotted out.]
Yithro
18
18:1	And Yithro heard [(of the splitting of the Red Sea and the war with Amalek and he came to join Israel)], the chief of Midian, the father-in-law of Moses [(Yithro now priding himself in Moses, whereas previously the reverse was the case (see 4:18)], all that G d had done [(the falling of the manna, the welling of the water, the defeat of Amalek)] with Moses and with Israel, His people [(Moses being equated with all of Israel)] — that the L rd had taken Israel out of Egypt [(this being the greatest of all)].
18:2	And Yithro, Moses' father-in-law took Tzipporah, Moses' wife, after she had been sent [back to her father's house to spare her suffering in Egypt].
18:3	And her two sons, the name of the first, Gershom; for he (Moses) said: "I was a stranger (ger) in a foreign land,"
18:4	And the name of the second, Eliezer, for (he said): "The G d of (Elokei) my father was my help (be'ezri), and He saved me from the sword of Pharaoh" [When Dathan and Aviram exposed Moses (see 2:14-15) and Pharaoh ordered him decapitated, his neck became a pillar of marble.]
18:5	And Yithro, Moses' father-in-law, and his sons and his wife came to Moses to the desert [(a tribute to Yithro, his leaving magnificence for the desert)], where he was encamped, (to the) mountain of G d.
18:6	And he said to Moses: I, your father-in-law, Yithro, am coming to you; and your wife and her two sons with her. [If you do not come out for my sake, come out for your wife's sake, and if not for her sake, for your sons' sake.]
18:7	And Moses went out to his father-in-law, [followed by Aaron, Nadav and Avihu, all who saw them following in their wake — a monumental show of honor to Yithro] and he [Moses] bowed down to him and kissed him, and they greeted each other, and they came into the tent.
18:8	And Moses related to his father-in-law [(to appeal to his feelings, to draw him to Torah)] all that the L rd did to Pharaoh and to Egypt on behalf of Israel, all the ordeals [(at the Red Sea and with Amalek)] that they had undergone upon the way and how the L rd had rescued them.
18:9	And Yithro rejoiced over all the good that the L rd had done to Israel [the manna, the well, the Torah, and, above all,] His rescuing them from the hand of Egypt. [Until now, one slave could not escape from Egypt — and now, six hundred thousand!]
18:10	And Yithro said: Blessed is the L rd, who rescued you from the hand of Egypt [a hard people] and from the hand of Pharaoh [a hard king], who rescued the people from under the [oppressive] hand of Egypt.
18:11	Now I know [even more than in the past] that greater is the L rd than all the gods [(There was no idolatry in the world that Yithro had not served)]. For [they (the Egyptians) were destroyed] by the [very] thing [water] whereby they devised evil against them.
18:12	And Yithro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and peace-offerings (for sacrifice) to G d. And Aaron and all the elders of Israel [(with Moses "in attendance")] came to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before G d [(whence it is seen that deriving enjoyment from a feast partaken of by Torah scholars is akin to basking in the Divine radiance)].
18:13	And it was [on the day after Yom Kippur] on the morrow [of Moses' descent from the mountain with the second tablets (This section is out of chronological order)] that Moses sat [like a king] to judge the people, and the people stood, (waiting) upon Moses from morning to evening ["Every judge who judges a true judgment in its (essential) truth, even for one moment, Scripture accounts it to him as if he had occupied himself with Torah the entire day ('from morning to evening') and as if he were a partner with the Holy One Blessed be He in the creation" (see Genesis 1:5)].
18:14	And Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, and he said: What is this thing that you do to the people? Why do you sit by yourself and all the people wait upon you from morning to evening?
18:15	And Moses said to his father-in-law: Because the people come to me to enquire [(concerning the law)] of G d.
18:16	When they have a matter [to be resolved], he [the one who "has the matter"] comes to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make known the statutes of G d and His laws.
18:17	And the father-in-law of Moses [(Scripture honoring Yithro by this appellation)] said to him: The thing that you do is not good.
18:18	You will languish, both you [including Aaron and Chur and the seventy elders] and this people that is with you. For this thing is beyond your strength; you will not be able to do it alone.
18:19	Now, hearken to my voice. I shall counsel you, and let G d be with you [in counsel; consult Him on this]. You be to the people [an intermediary] to G d, [receiving judgment from Him], and you bring the matters [i.e., their disputes] to G d.
18:20	And you shall exhort them in respect to the statutes and the Toroth; and you shall apprise them of the way in which they shall go, and of the deed that they shall do.
18:21	And you shall see from all the people [through the holy spirit that is upon you] men of valor [rich men, who need not toady to anyone], fearers of G d, trustworthy men, haters of gain [at the expense of integrity]; and (from these) place over them (the people) officers of thousands [600 officers for 600,000]; officers of hundreds, [6,000]; officers of fifties [12,000]; and officers of tens [60,000].
18:22	And they shall judge the people at all times. And it shall be, every major thing shall they bring to you, and every minor thing shall they themselves judge, and it shall be easier for you, and they shall bear (the burden) with you.
18:23	If you do this thing and G d will command you [to do it], then you will be able to bear up [(but not if He does not command you to do it)]; and also all of this people [Aaron, Nadav, Avihu, and the seventy elders who are with you] shall come to their place in peace.
18:24	And Moses heeded his father-in-law's voice, and he did all that he said.
18:25	And Moses chose men of valor from all of Israel, and he made them heads of the people: officers of thousands, officers of hundreds, officers of fifties, and officers of tens.
18:26	And they judged the people at all times. The hard thing they brought to Moses, and the small thing they themselves judged.
18:27	And Moses sent his father-in-law and he went to his land [to proselytize his family].
19
19:1	On the third month of the exodus of the children of Israel from the land of Egypt, on this day [on the New Moon ("Let words of Torah always be 'new' to you, as if they were given this day")], they came to the desert of Sinai.
19:2	And they journeyed from Refidim and they came to the desert of Sinai [(Just as they came to the desert of Sinai in a state of penitence, so they had left Refidim in a state of penitence.)] And Israel encamped there ["as one man, with one heart"] opposite [i.e., east of] the mountain.
19:3	And Moses went up to G d [early in the morning on the second day] and the L rd called to him from the mountain, saying: Thus shall you say [(in this mode and in this order)] to the house of Jacob [the women (To them, "say" it, "gently")], and speak (tagid) to the children of Israel [the men. (Lay down for them the things which are "tough as sinews" (giddin), the punishments and the details of the mitzvoth)].
19:4	You have seen [with your own eyes] what I did to Egypt [on your behalf], and I bore you [(all of you in one day, from the places of your dispersion in the land of Goshen, to Ramses, assembling you for the Exodus)] on eagles' wings, [My angel protecting you from the projectiles of the foe (see 14:19-20), as an eagle, the highest flying of the birds, protects its young from other birds by carrying them on its wings], and I brought you to Me.
19:5	And now [(If you take it upon yourselves now, it will be "pleasant" for you in the future, all beginnings being difficult)], if you hearken to My voice and observe My covenant [that I shall make with you for the keeping of the Torah], then you shall be unto Me a select treasure, above all the (other) peoples; for all the earth [including the other peoples] is Mine, [(so that in choosing you it is clear that I am choosing you above them)].
19:6	And you shall be to Me a kingdom of lords and a holy nation. These are the words, [not less and not more] that you shall speak to the children of Israel.
19:7	And Moses came, and he called to the elders of the people, and he put before them all these things that the L rd had commanded him.
19:8	And all the people answered together and they said: Whatever the L rd has spoken we shall do. And Moses [on the third day] returned the words of the people to the L rd, [Moses doing what was "proper," though in no way "needed."]
19:9	And the L rd said to Moses: Behold, I shall come to you in the thickness of the cloud so that the people hear when I speak with you, and also in you [and in the prophets that follow you] they will believe forever. And [on the fourth day] Moses told the words of the people [(to the effect that they wished to hear it from the King's own mouth)] to the L rd.
19:10	And the L rd said to Moses: Go to the people and make them ready today and tomorrow, and have them wash their garments.
19:11	And have them be ready for the third day [the sixth of Sivan (and on the fifth he erected the altar and the twelve monuments (see 24:4)], for on the third day the L rd will go down before the eyes of all the people [(the blind being cured)] on Mount Sinai.
19:12	And demarcate bounds for the people roundabout, [the bounds] "saying": Take heed unto yourselves not to go up on the mountain or to touch [even] its edge. Whoever touches the mountain shall be put to death.
19:13	No hand shall touch it; for stoned shall he be stoned or cast down shall he be cast down [(whence it is derived that those executed by stoning are cast down from the stoning site, two (men's) statures high)]. Whether beast or man, he shall not live. When the ram's horn sounds, [indicating the departure of the Shechinah], they may go up on the mountain.
19:14	And Moses went down [directly (not pausing for personal matters)] from the mountain to the people and he made the people ready, and they washed their garments.
19:15	And he said to the people: Be ready in three days. Do not draw near to a woman [for three days, (so that the woman can immerse on the third day and be ready (i.e., pure) to receive the Torah, ejected semen being "neutralized" by the third day)].
19:16	And it was, on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a heavy cloud upon the mountain, and the sound of the shofar, very strong, [the Holy One Blessed be He preceding them — what flesh and blood would not do (the "Rabbi" waiting for His disciple!)], and all the people in the camp trembled.
19:17	And Moses took out the people towards G d, [(who was coming towards them, as a groom to a bride)] from the encampment, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
19:18	And the whole of Mount Sinai smoked, for the L rd had come down upon it in fire, and its smoke rose like the smoke of a lime kiln, and the whole mountain trembled greatly.
19:19	And the sound of the shofar grew exceedingly strong [(the reverse of the normal phenomenon)]. When Moses spoke [the last eight commandments (after they had heard the first two from the L rd Himself)], G d answered him [i.e., acceded to his request] regarding the [amplification of his] voice, [so that he could be heard by the multitude].
19:20	And the L rd descended upon Mount Sinai [(He bent the heavens and spread them over the mountain, and the Throne of Glory descended upon them)] upon the top of the mountain. And the L rd called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
19:21	And the L rd said to Moses: Go down and warn the people [(not to ascend the mountain)], lest they break [their bounds in aspiring] to the L rd to see, [and they draw near to the side of the mountain], and there fall of them many, [(even the falling of one of them being regarded as the falling of "many")].
19:22	And also the priests [i.e., the first-born], who draw near to the L rd [to offer sacrifices], let them [not ascend, but let them] be in readiness [to take their assigned stations], lest the L rd [kill them and] make a breach in them.
19:23	And Moses said to the L rd: The people will not be able to ascend Mount Sinai, for You [already] warned us, saying: Demarcate bounds for the mountain and hallow it. [There is no need, then, for me to warn them again.]
19:24	And the L rd said to him: Go, descend, [and warn them again, (prompting to zeal being called for both before the deed and at the time of the deed)], and go up, you [in your precincts] and Aaron with you [in his precincts], and the priests [in their precincts] — and the people, let them not break [their bounds at all] to ascend to the L rd, lest He make a breach in them.
19:25	And Moses went down to the people and he said (it) [this warning] to them.
20
20:1	And G d [Elokim, the Judge, "exacting payment" (for all of the ten commandments, unlike some other sections in the Torah, where performance is rewarded, but non-performance not punished)] spoke all of these things [miraculously, in one utterance (after which He reiterated each commandment individually)] saying, [i.e., the people responding in the affirmative or in the negative as per the nature of the commandment]:
20:2	I am the L rd your G d who took you out of the land of Egypt [Having taken you out is sufficient reason that you be subservient to Me.] ("your [singular] G d") [an opening for Moses to plead for Israel in the episode of the golden calf, viz.: "You said this ("your G d") to me, not to them!"] from the house of [Pharaoh, to whom you were] servants.
20:3	There shall not be unto you [(You may not keep them even if you do not make them)] gods of [i.e., made by] others before My presence [i.e., idolatry is interdicted not for this generation alone but eternally (just as I am eternally present)].
20:4	You shall not make for yourself a graven image or the likeness of anything which is in the heavens above or in the earth below, or in the waters beneath the earth.
20:5	You shall not bow down to them and you shall not serve them, for I am the L rd your G d, a jealous G d, ["jealous" to exact punishment, and not "overlooking" idolatry], visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children, for the third and the fourth generations to those who hate Me, [those who perpetuate their fathers' ways],
20:6	and doing lovingkindness [i.e., "guarding" the lovingkindness that a man does, to reward him] for thousands [of generations], for My lovers and the keepers of My mitzvoth, [whence (5 and 6) it is seen that G d's "measure" of reward is greater than His measure for punishment].
20:7	You shall not take the name of the L rd your G d in vain [by swearing at variance with what is known, e.g., that a pillar of stone is one of gold], for the L rd will not absolve him who takes His name in vain.
20:8	Have [always] in remembrance the Sabbath day [("Remember" and "Keep" (Deuteronomy 5:12) were stated in one pronouncement)] to set it apart [i.e., If you chance upon something specially fine, set it apart for the Sabbath].
20:9	Six days shall you work, and you shall do all of your labor [i.e., When Shabbath arrives, let it be in your eyes as if all your labor has been done and give it no thought.]
20:10	And the seventh day is Sabbath to the L rd your G d. You shall not perform any labor: you, and your son, and your daughter [minors — parents being exhorted vis-à-vis their young children], your man-servant, and your maid-servant, and your beast, and your sojourner in your gates.
20:11	For, six days did the L rd make the heavens and the earth, the seas and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day. [How much more so, then, must we — who feel toil — rest on that day!] Therefore, the L rd blessed the Sabbath day [by providing a double portion of manna on the sixth day], and He sanctified it [by not having the manna fall on the Sabbath].
20:12	Honor your father and your mother so that your days be prolonged on the earth that the L rd your G d gives to you, [the implication being that if you do not honor them your days will be shortened.]
20:13	You shall not kill. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal [a human being, i.e., kidnap]. You shall not testify against your neighbor false testimony.
20:14	You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, and his man-servant, and his maid-servant, and his ox and his ass, and all that belongs to your neighbor.
20:15	And all the people saw [(whence we derive that there were no blind ones among them)] ["saw" miraculously] the sounds [emanating from the Mighty One's mouth], and the lightnings, and the sound of the shofar, and the mountain smoking. And the people saw and they shuddered, and they stood far off. [(They recoiled twelve mil, the distance of their encampment, and ministering angels came and restored them)]
20:16	And they said to Moses: Speak, you with us, and we shall hear; and let G d not speak with us, lest we die.
20:17	And Moses said to the people: Do not fear, for to uplift you has G d come and so that His fear [engendered by beholding His awe] be upon your faces, that you not sin.
20:18	And the people stood from afar, and Moses drew near [within the three divisions: "darkness, cloud, and mist" (Deuteronomy 4:11)] to the mist [the "thickness of the cloud" (19:9)], where G d was.
20:19	And the L rd said to Moses: Thus shall you say to the children of Israel: You saw [with your own eyes] that from the heavens I spoke to you ["to exhort you, and on the earth He showed you His great fire" (Deuteronomy 4:36)]
20:20	You shall not make [likenesses of those (the angels) who minister] unto Me. Gods of silver [(If you make the cherubs who "stand with Me" of silver (instead of the prescribed gold), they will be considered "gods" (i.e., idols)], and gods of gold [(If you make more than two cherubs of gold, they will be considered "gods")], do not make for yourselves [i.e., in your synagogues and study halls, as I have bidden you make in the Temple].
20:21	An altar [fixed upon the] earth shall you make for Me, [i.e., in My name], and you shall slaughter beside it your burnt-offerings and your peace-offerings, [which come from] your flocks and your herds. Wherever I [permit you to] mention My name [i.e., in the Temple, where the Cohanim are authorized to utter the Ineffable Name in the priestly blessing], I shall come to you, [i.e., there shall I repose My shechinah] and I shall bless you.
20:22	And when you make an altar of stones unto Me, do not build them hewn, for if you lift your sword upon it, you profane it [(the altar being created to prolong life, and the sword, to shorten it)].
20:23	And do not go up by steps, [but by a smooth ramp] upon My altar, so that your nakedness not be revealed upon it [by your having to take (relatively) long strides].
Mishpatim
21
21:1	And these [(Just as what precedes was stated at Sinai, so these)] are the judgments [(this section being juxtaposed with that of the altar to teach that the Sanhedrin should preside near the sanctuary)] that you should set [(as a "set" table, the judgments not merely to be mandated to them, but to be "digested" for them)] before them [and not before gentiles, even if their law, in the instance in question, coincides with Jewish law (this, to avoid diminution of the honor of Heaven)].
21:2	If you buy [from beth-din] a Hebrew man-servant, six years shall he serve, and in the seventh he shall go out to freedom, gratis.
21:3	If alone [without a wife] he came, alone shall he go out [(If he were not married when he came, his master may not give him a Canaanite bondswoman for the begetting of slaves)]. If he were the husband of a [Jewish] woman, then his wife shall go out with him. [(When did she come in?) It is hereby derived that one who buys a Hebrew man-servant is required to feed his wife and children.]
21:4	If his master gives him a woman [a Canaanite bondswoman], and she bears him sons or daughters, then the woman and her children shall belong to her master, and he shall go out alone.
21:5	And if the man-servant will say: I love my master, my wife [the bondswoman] and my children; I shall not go out free,
21:6	then his master shall bring him near to the judges [(The man-servant must consult the judges who sold him)], and he shall bring him near to the door or to the door-post [(Just as a door-post stands (in its place), so the door (against which his ear is bored) must be standing)], and his master shall bore his [right] ear with an awl, and he shall serve him forever [i.e., until the Jubilee year]. [Why the ear? The ear which heard on Mount Sinai: "Thou shalt not steal!" and he went and stole (for which reason beth-din sold him) — let his ear be bored! Or, if he sold himself: The ear which heard on Mount Sinai: "For unto Me are the children of Israel servants" and he went and acquired a master for himself — let his ear be bored! And why door and door-post? The Holy One Blessed be He said: The door and the door-post, which were witnesses in Egypt when I skipped over the lintel and the two door-posts (on which the Jews had sprinkled the blood of the Paschal lamb), and I said: "For unto Me are the children of Israel servants" — and not servants to servants (i.e., the Egyptians) and this one went and acquired a master for himself! Let his ear (that heard and did not listen) be bored (in their presence!)]
21:7	And if a man sells his daughter [a minor (under twelve)] as a maid, she shall not go out as the [Canaanite] bondsmen go out, [with the master's knocking out a tooth or an eye (but: at the end of six years, at the Jubilee year, or at her bringing (pubertal) signs — whichever is first)].
21:8	If she be ill-favored in the eyes of her master, who [on that account] did not designate her [to be his wife, even though he should have], then he shall [help] redeem her [by deducting from her six-year redemption money the value of the service she had already rendered]. To a strange nation [i.e., to another man] he [both the master and the father] shall not presume to sell her, after he [the master, by not taking her to wife, or the father, by selling her] has been faithless to her.
21:9	And if [as is the master's prerogative,] to his son he designate her, [(the purchase money serving as the betrothal money)], according to the ordinance of the daughters ["her food, her clothing, and her (conjugal) time" (10)] shall he provide for her.
21:10	If another (wife) he take for himself [in addition to her], her [the first one's] food, her clothing, and her (conjugal) time he shall not diminish.
21:11	And if [one of] these three [viz. marrying her himself, marrying her to his son, or deducting from her redemption money] he does not do to her, then she shall go out gratis, without money [(Scripture providing an additional way for her to go out, viz., showing signs of puberty)].
21:12	If one strikes a man [(only one who is destined to be a "man," and not a fetus that is certain to die of itself)], and he dies, then, [i.e., only if it is a death-dealing blow], he shall be put to death.
21:13	And if he did not lie in wait (for him), but G d put (him) into his hand, then I shall make for you a place [even (now) in the desert] where he shall flee, [that place being the Levite encampment.]
21:14	And if a man be deliberate, [and not unwitting] against his neighbor, [and not against a gentile], to kill him with subtlety [(to exclude a doctor whose patient dies as a result of his treatment, a bailiff of beth-din who kills in the administration of stripes, and one whose son or disciple dies under his chastisement)], from My altar [if he were a Cohein and wished to perform the priestly service] shall you take him to die.
21:15	And if one strikes [and wounds] his father or his mother, he shall be put to death [by strangulation (unlike one who wounds another, who pays but is not killed)].
21:16	And if one, [including a woman, tumtum (one of indeterminate gender) or hermaphrodite], kidnapped a man and sold him, and he were found in his hand, [i.e., men having witnessed his being kidnapped and sold and his having been in the kidnapper's hand before the sale], he (the kidnapper) shall be put to death [by stoning].
21:17	And if one [including a woman] curses his father or his mother, he shall be put to death [by stoning].
21:18	And if men quarrel and a man strike his neighbor with stone or fist and he not die, but become bedridden [and work-disabled],
21:19	If he arise and walk outside on his own power, then the striker shall be absolved [(the striker being imprisoned pending resolution of the victim's state)]; only his work-disability [payment] shall he (the striker) give, and heal shall he heal [i.e., he shall pay medical expenses].
21:20	And if a man strike his [Canaanite] man-servant or maid-servant with a rod [of killing potential], and he die under his hand, vengeance [by the sword] shall be taken.
21:21	But if one day or two days [i.e., one day which is like two days, a twenty-four hour period] he survive, vengeance shall not be taken, for he (the man-servant) is his money, [but if another (i.e., not his master) kills him, even if the servant lingered on that long, he (the murderer) is put to death].
21:22	And if men fight [with each other and one strikes at the other] and they hit a pregnant woman, and her fetuses miscarry, and there be no death [in the woman], then he shall be punished [i.e., payment (for the fetuses) shall be exacted of him.] As the husband of the woman imposes upon him (the striker) [through beth-din] he shall give by word of the judges.
21:23	And if there be death [in the woman] then you shall give a life for a life [(According to one view, "life," literally; according to another, monetary payment, estimated by the sales-price of servants in the marketplace)].
21:24	An eye for an eye [(If one blinded another, he pays him the monetary value of an eye, estimated by loss of value of a blinded servant in the marketplace)]; a tooth for a tooth; a hand for a hand; a foot for a foot.
21:25	A burn [produced by fire] for a burn [(monetary payment, estimated by how much one would give to be spared the pain of the burn)]; a wound [(where blood is drawn)] for a wound [(Though he makes the other payments (loss of limb, disability, etc.,) he is not exempt from payment for pain)]; a welt [(where no blood is drawn)] for a welt.
21:26	And if a man strike the eye of his [Canaanite] man-servant or the eye of his maid-servant, and he destroy it, free shall he send him in lieu of his eye [or any other organ prominences which do not grow back (excluding a child's tooth)].
21:27	And if the tooth [(though one is not born with it, unlike "eye")] of his man-servant or the tooth of his maid-servant he strike out, free shall he send him in lieu of his tooth.
21:28	And if an ox [(or any other animal)] gore a man or a woman and he die, the ox shall be stoned and its flesh shall not be eaten [even if it is slaughtered after judgment has been pronounced upon it], and the owner of the ox is absolved ["the owner" of a tam (an ox that is not "confirmed" in killing, as opposed to a mued, a three-time killer ox. See 29)]
21:29	And if it were a goring ox from yesterday and the day before, [three gorings (including the latest), and the owner were warned [in the presence of witnesses], and he did not guard it, and it killed [(by goring or otherwise)] a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner, too, shall die [at the hands of Heaven].
21:30	When kofer ["atonement" (payment)] is set for him, he shall give the redemption of his soul [(According to one view, the value of the victim; according to another, the value of the owner)], according to all that shall be set for him.
21:31	Or if it gore a son [a minor], or it gore a daughter [a minor], according to this ordinance shall it be done to him.
21:32	If the ox gore a [Canaanite] man-servant or maid-servant, then silver, thirty shekels, shall he give to his master [regardless of how much he is worth] and the ox shall be stoned.
21:33	And if a man open a pit [(in the public domain) which was covered] or if a man dig a pit [even if he completes another's digging], and he not cover it, and there fall into it an ox or an ass [or any other animal],
21:34	the owner of the pit [i.e., the one who occasioned the damage, whether or not he be the actual owner] shall pay. Money shall he restore [(any kind of "restoration," even bran)] to its owner, and the carcass shall belong to him [the latter (as partial payment towards damages)].
21:35	And if the ox [a tam ("non-confirmed" in damaging)] of a man strike [(any kind of "striking" — butting, kicking, biting, etc.)] the ox of his neighbor, and it die, then they shall sell the living ox and halve its money [between them] and also the [value of the] carcass shall they halve [between them (so that the owner of the tam, where both oxen are of equal value, pays half-damages)].
21:36	Or [if it were not a tam, but] it be known that it were a goring ox [a mued] from yesterday and the day before, [three gorings (including the latest)], and its owner did not guard it, then pay shall he pay, an ox [full value] for an ox, and the carcass shall belong to him [the owner of the gored ox, (the owner of the goring ox making up the difference between the value of the carcass and the full value of the gored ox)].
21:37	If a man steal an ox or a lamb, and slaughter it or sell it, then five (head of) cattle shall he pay for the ox, and four sheep for the lamb, ["ox" and "lamb," specifically (Only four for the lamb, as opposed to five for the ox, for the thief suffers shame in carrying the lamb (whereas he leads the ox)].
22
22:1	If the thief be found breaking in, and he be struck (by the owner) and die, he (the owner) has no blood [liability, the thief coming with intent to kill the owner if necessary, and "If one comes to kill you, arise and kill him!"]
22:2	If the sun shone upon him [i.e., If it is obvious that the thief would not kill him (as in the instance of a father stealing from a son)], he (the thief) "has blood" [i.e., he is regarded as a "live man," and one who kills him is a murderer.] Pay shall he [the thief] pay [for what he stole (but he is not to be put to death)]. If he lacks it, he is to be sold for his theft.
22:3	If the theft be found in his hand [i.e., in his possession, he neither having slaughtered it nor sold it], from ox to ass, to lamb [(all objects are included)], living (animals) [or their value, and not dead animals], double shall he pay.
22:4	If a man take his beast into a field or a vineyard and he send his beast [and it tread, causing damage] or ravage [by the "tooth"] in the field of another, then the best of his (the animal owner's) field and the best of his vineyard shall he pay [if he wishes to pay him in land].
22:5	If fire go out [even of itself] and it find thorns, and there be consumed [by the progress of the fire in the thorns] sheaves, or the standing corn, or the field, [his furrow being singed so that it has to be re-plowed], pay shall he pay, he that lights the fire [even though he lights it in his own property and it moves of itself by means of the thorns].
22:6	If a man give to his neighbor money or vessels to watch [without pay], and it be stolen from the house of the man [(this being the latter's claim)], if the thief is found, he shall pay double [to the owner].
22:7	If the thief not be found, then the master of the house [where the article had been deposited] shall draw near to the judges [to deliberate with the owner and to swear to him] that he has not sent his hand against his neighbor's deposit.
22:8	For every matter of offense, [where he is found to have lied under oath, witnesses testifying that he himself stole it, and the judges incriminating him on their testimony], for an ox, for an ass, for a lamb, for a garment, for every lost object about which he [the witness] will say that it is this [whereunto you swore that it was stolen, and, behold, you have it], unto the judges, [who shall cross-examine the witnesses,] shall come the matter of both, [and] whom the judges shall incriminate [i.e., the watcher, if he is found guilty], shall pay double to his neighbor.
22:9	If a man give to his neighbor an ass or an ox or a lamb or any beast to watch [for pay], and it die [naturally] or be broken or seized [by robbers], no one seeing [to testify to this],
22:10	the oath of the L rd shall be between both, that he (the watcher) did not send his hand against the deposit of his neighbor [to use it for himself (for if he did, and it afterwards met with mischance, he is liable)], and its owner shall accept [the oath], and he [the watcher] shall not pay.
22:11	And if it were stolen from him, he shall pay its owner.
22:12	If it were torn [by a wild beast], let him bring witnesses [to that effect and thereby free himself of liability]. For the torn (beast) [(which he could not save, as when it was torn by a lion)] he shall not pay.
22:13	And if a man borrow from his neighbor and it be broken or die, its owner not being with (i.e., engaged by) him [the borrower, in his work], pay shall he (the borrower) pay.
22:14	If its owner were with him [whether in the same work (as the animal) or some other work, even if he were not with him at the time of breaking or death], he (the borrower) shall not pay. If it (the animal) were hired, it came by its hire [into the hands of the hirer, who, paying for it, (unlike the borrower), is not liable for mischance. (There is a difference of opinion as to whether he is to be regarded as an unpaid watcher or as a paid one.)]
22:15	And if a man entice a virgin who is not betrothed and he lie with her, he shall endower her unto himself as a wife [i.e., he shall write her a kethubah (a marriage contract) and marry her.]
22:16	If her father refuse to give her to him, money shall he pay [fifty shekels] as per the indemnity for the [ravished] virgins (see Deuteronomy 22:29)].
22:17	A witch you shall not allow to live, [but you shall kill her, or him, as the case may be, (in beth-din)].
22:18	Anyone who lies with a beast [either actively or passively] shall be put to death [by stoning].
22:19	One who slaughters [(or performs any inner Temple service, like slaughtering) to idolatry shall be put to death — only to the L rd alone!
22:20	And a stranger [from another land] you shall not taunt and you shall not oppress him [by theft], for you were strangers in the land of Egypt [and are equally vulnerable to taunting].
22:21	Every widow and orphan you shall not afflict. [All men are intended; it is just that "widow and orphan" are more vulnerable to affliction.]
22:22	If you afflict him, [you will receive your just deserts]; for if he but cry out to Me, I will hear his cry.
22:23	And My wrath shall burn and I shall kill you by the sword, and your wives will be widows, and your children, orphans [There will be no witnesses to your death, and your wives will not be able to remarry or your sons to inherit you.]
22:24	When you lend money, [lend it, preferentially, in this order:] My people [before heathens], the poor man [before the relatively wealthier] with you [in your city, before the poor of other cities]. Do not be to him as a creditor [Do not be severe in demanding payment. If you know that he is without means, act towards him as if you had not lent him.] Do not impose interest (neshech) upon him, [neshech — "biting." Interest is like the biting of a snake. It begins with an almost imperceptible wound and then "swells" up to one's head.]
22:25	If you take as a pledge the garment of your neighbor [after the time for repayment of the loan arrives and he does not pay], until the setting of the sun return it to him. [Scripture here speaks of a day garment, which is not needed at night. (Restore it for the day and you may take it again at night.)]
22:26	For it is his solitary covering, [his outer garment]; it is his shirt for his skin [his inner garment]. On what shall he lie? [This includes his couch (as having to be returned for the day.)] And it shall be, if he cries out to Me, I shall hear; for I am gracious.
22:27	Elohim you shall not curse [(an exhortation against cursing G d and against cursing a judge)], and a prince in your people you shall not curse.
22:28	Your fullness [the obligation that is incumbent upon you when your produce has fully ripened, i.e., bikkurim (first fruits)] and your dema (terumah) you shall not delay [you are not to change the order of their separation. You are not to take terumah before bikkurim or ma'aser before terumah]. The first-born of your sons you shall give to Me [(Redeem him from the Cohein for five sela'im)].
22:29	Thus shall you do with your ox, with your sheep [i.e., Just as a human bechor is redeemed after thirty days, so the bechor of small cattle (e.g., sheep) is to be looked after for thirty days and then given to the Cohein.] Seven days shall it be with its mother [(an exhortation to the Cohein not to sacrifice it before the eighth day)]; on the eighth day you may give it to Me.
22:30	And [if] men of holiness [i.e., If you separate yourselves from abominations of neveilah and treifah], you shall be unto Me [i.e., you shall be Mine; if not, you shall not be Mine.] And flesh torn [by a predatory animal from a live clean animal] in the field [(not necessarily the field, "the field" being the common instance)] you shall not eat; to the dog you shall throw it [or you may sell it to a heathen ("the dog" being mentioned to indicate that it takes precedence to selling and also that "the Holy One Blessed be He does not withhold the reward of any creature" (see 11:7)].
23
23:1	Do not bear a false report [(an exhortation against receiving slander and an exhortation to a judge not to hear the words of one litigant before the other arrives)]. Do not place your hand with an evildoer [who puts forth a false claim against his neighbor] to [promise him to] be a false witness [for him].
23:2	Do not incline [in judgment] after many [wicked men, simply because they are many] for evil. And do not answer [the defendant, who solicits your judgment] in the dispute, to incline after [those] many [wicked ones] to incline [the judgment from the truth; but judge in accordance with the truth and "let the collar (of responsibility) hang on the neck of the many"].
23:3	And do not honor a poor man in his quarrel [to favor him in judgment simply because he is poor].
23:4	If you encounter the ox of your foe, or his ass, straying, return shall you return it to him.
23:5	Would you see the ass of your foe lying under its burden and forbear to help [disburden] it? Help shall you help [unload it] with him [the owner].
23:6	Do not incline the judgment of your needy one in his quarrel.
23:7	From a thing of falsehood keep far, and a clean one and a righteous one you shall not kill [("a clean one": If you have something to say in his favor after he has been sentenced to death, the case is to be reopened. "a righteous one": If you have something to say against him after he has been acquitted (i.e., found "righteous") the case is not to be re-opened)], for I will not find the wicked one righteous [(so that even if he has been erroneously acquitted, "the L rd has many messengers")].
23:8	And a bribe you shall not take [even to judge truly], for a bribe blinds the wise and undermines righteous words [i.e., true judgments].
23:9	And a stranger you shall not oppress. And you have known the soul of the stranger [how he suffers under oppression], for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.
23:10	And six years shall you sow your land and you shall gather [into your house] its produce.
23:11	And the seventh year it shall lie fallow [and not be worked] and you shall leave it [i.e., you shall not eat of its produce after the time of removal (see Leviticus 25:7)], and the poor of your people shall eat it, and what they leave shall be eaten by the animals of the field [(Just as it need not be tithed for animals, so it need not be tithed for the poor — whence it is derived that ma'aser does not obtain in the sabbatical year)]. Thus shall you [also] do with your vineyard and with your olive grove, [(what precedes applying to a grain field)].
23:12	Six days shall you do your work, and on the seventh day shall you rest [i.e., Shabbath is not superseded by Shevi'ith (which is also a commemoration of the creation)], so that there rest your ox and your ass [Give it "resting," i.e., allow it to tear grass from the earth and eat it], and there be refreshed the son of your maidservant [an uncircumcised Canaanite servant] and the stranger [a ger toshav, a "sojourning stranger" (one who shuns idolatry and observes the seven Noachide laws)].
23:13	And all that I have spoken to you, you shall observe [(all positive commandments are hereby "affixed" with an exhortation)]. And the name of other gods you shall not mention [One should not say to another: "Wait for me near that idol" (mentioning its name) or "Stand with me on the festival of that idol"]; it shall not be heard [from the gentile] upon your mouth [i.e., at your instigation. (Do not enter into partnership with a gentile, lest he swear by his god (in the instance of a dispute) in which instance you are an accessory to the mentioning of idolatry.)]
23:14	Three times shall you celebrate for Me in the year.
23:15	The festival of matzoth shall you keep. Seven days shall you eat matzoth, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of aviv, [when the grain begins to ripen]; for in it did you go out of Egypt. And they shall not appear before Me empty-handed, [but they shall bring burnt-offerings].
23:16	And the festival of the harvest [Shavuoth], the [time of bringing the] first-fruits of your labor, which you sow in the field [(the two loaves of Shavuoth permitting the new wheat for meal-offerings and the bringing of first-fruits to the Temple, viz. (Numbers 28:26)], and the festival of the ingathering [Succoth] at the going out of the year, when you gather your labor from the field [against the rain].
23:17	Three times in the year shall appear all the males among you in the presence of the Master, the L rd, [the festivals not lapsing in the sabbatical year].
23:18	You shall not offer alongside chametz the blood of My sacrifice [i.e., Do not slaughter the Pesach offering on the fourteenth of Nissan until the chametz has been removed], and there shall not remain [unplaced on the altar] the fat of My festival offering until morning.
23:19	The first of the first-fruits of your land [even in the sabbatical year] you shall bring to the house of the L rd your G d. You shall not cook a kid [any young, tender animal] in its mother's milk. [This is written three times in the Torah: (here, 34:26, and Deuteronomy 14:21), once to forbid eating (milk and meat together), once to forbid derivation of benefit, and once to forbid cooking.]
23:20	Behold, I shall send an angel before you [(the L rd here apprising them that they would sin, that He would not go up among them (33:3) and that they would require an intermediary)], to watch over you on the way, and to bring you to the place that I have readied [for you].
23:21	Take heed of him and hearken to his voice. Do not rebel against him, for he will not forgive your offenses, [sin being foreign to his nature and forgiveness not being deputed to him. "Take heed of him"] for My name is within him [i.e., associated with him].
23:22	But if you hearken to his voice and do all that I shall speak, then I shall hate your enemies and oppress your oppressors.
23:23	For My angel shall go before you, and he will bring you to the Emori, and the Chitti and the Perizi and the Canaani and the Chivi and the Yevussi, and I will annihilate them.
23:24	Do not bow down to their gods and do not worship them and do not emulate their deeds, but raze them [their idols] and break down their [stone] monuments [which they set up to bow down to].
23:25	And you shall serve the L rd your G d, and He will bless your bread and your water, and I shall remove sickness from your midst.
23:26	There shall not be [if you do My will] a woman bereft [(of her young, miscarrying or burying them)] or barren in your land; the number of your days shall I complete.
23:27	My fright shall I send before you, and I shall confound all the people among whom you come, and I shall set the nape of all your foes before you [in fleeing you].
23:28	And I shall send the hornet before you, and it shall drive out the Chivvi, the Canaani, and the Chitti before you.
23:29	I will not drive them out before you in one year lest the land be left desolate and the animals of the field increase against you.
23:30	Little by little I will drive them out before you until you multiply and inherit the land.
23:31	And I shall set your boundaries from the Red Sea until the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert until the river. For I will put in your hand the inhabitants of the land, and you will drive them out before you.
23:32	You shall not make a covenant with them or with their gods.
23:33	They shall not dwell in your land lest they cause you to sin against Me, that you serve their gods and they be a stumbling block to you.
24
24:1	And to Moses He said [(before the Ten Commandments) on the fourth of Sivan]: Go up to the L rd, you and Aaron, Nadav and Avihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and bow down from afar.
24:2	And Moses alone shall draw near [to the mist] to the L rd, but they shall not draw near, and the people shall not go up with him.
24:3	And Moses came and he told the people [on that day] all the words of the L rd [the commandment of separation (from conjugal relations) and the keeping of bounds (from Mount Sinai)] and all of the judgments [the seven Noachide laws, Sabbath, honoring of father and mother, and the administration of justice, which had been related to them at Marah]. And the people answered with one voice and said: All of the things which the L rd has spoken we shall do.
23:4	And Moses wrote all the words of the L rd [from the creation until the giving of the Torah, and he wrote down the mitzvoth given at Marah] and he arose early in the morning [on the fifth of Sivan] and he built an altar at the foot of the mountain and twelve monuments for the twelve tribes of Israel.
24:5	And he sent the youths [i.e., the first-born] of the children of Israel, and they offered up burnt-offerings and slaughtered sacrifices, peace-offerings to the L rd, bullocks.
24:6	And Moses took half of the blood [(an angel coming and halving it)] and he placed it in basins [(two basins: one for half the blood of the burnt-offering; the other, for half the blood of the peace-offering to sprinkle upon the people (whence our sages infer that our ancestors entered the covenant through circumcision, immersion, and the sprinkling of blood, there being no sprinkling without immersion)], and half the blood he sprinkled upon the altar.
24:7	And he took the book of the covenant [(from the creation until the giving of the Torah and the mitzvoth given at Marah)], and he read (it) in the ears of the people, and they said: All that the L rd has spoken we shall do and we shall hear.
24:8	And Moses took the blood and sprinkled it upon the people, and he said: Behold, the blood of the covenant, which the L rd has made with you over all these words.
24:9	And there went up Moses and Aaron, Nadav and Avihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel.
24:10	And they saw the G d of Israel [They "peeked" and were liable to death, but the Holy One Blessed be He, desiring not to dampen the joy of (receiving the) Torah "waited" for Nadav and Avihu until the consecration of the tabernacle, and for the elders until the episode of the complainers (Numbers 11:16)], and under His feet, as the work of a sapphire brick [This was before Him at the time of the (Egyptian) bondage to "keep Him in mind" of the brick-toil of the Jews] and as the appearance of the heavens in brightness. [When they were redeemed, there was light and rejoicing before Him.]
24:11	And against the nobles of the children of Israel [Nadav, Avihu, and the elders], He did not send forth His hand [(whence it is to be derived that it would have been warranted)], and they gazed upon G d [grossly] while eating and drinking.
24:12	And the L rd said to Moses [after the giving of the Torah]: Go up to Me to the mountain and be there [forty days], and I shall give you the tablets of stone and the Torah and the mitzvah which I have written to teach them. [All the six hundred and thirteen mitzvoth are contained in the Ten Commandments.]
24:13	And Moses arose and Joshua his attendant, and Moses went up to the mountain of G d, [Joshua accompanying him as far as he was permitted to go, pitching his tent there and awaiting Moses' return].
24:14	And to the elders he said [upon leaving the encampment]: Abide for us here [with the rest of the people to be "on call" for judging their disputes] until we return to you, and, behold, Aaron and Chur [(the son of Miriam and Calev ben Yefuneh)] are with you. Whoever has a claim (against his fellow) shall draw near to them.
24:15	And Moses went up to the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.
24:16	And the glory of the L rd reposed upon Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it and He called to Moses on the seventh day from the midst of the cloud. [Or, according to another view, him. ("it"): "And the glory of the L rd reposed upon Mount Sinai and the cloud covered it for six days [from Rosh Chodesh Sivan], and He called to Moses [(all of Israel standing there, but Moses being singled out for special honor)] on the seventh day [to declare the Ten Commandments] from the midst of the cloud." ("him"): "And the glory of the L rd reposed upon Mount Sinai and the cloud covered him for six days [after the Ten Commandments, the beginning of the forty days of Moses' going up to receive the tablets (Scripture teaching that entrance into the "Divine Encampment" (later, the Holy of Holies) requires a six-day separation period)], and He called to Moses on the seventh day from the midst of the cloud."]
24:17	And the sight of the glory of the L rd was like a consuming fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of Israel.
24:18	And Moses came in the midst of the cloud, [G d making a kind of path for him in its midst], and he went up to the mountain. And Moses was in the mountain forty days and forty nights.
Terumah
25
25:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
25:2	Speak to the children of Israel and let them take for Me [i.e., for My Name's sake] terumah [a tithe]. From every man whose heart prompts him shall you take My terumah. [Three terumoth are referred to here: the terumah of a beka for a head, of which the sockets were made; the terumah of the altar, a beka for a head, for the communal offering funds; and the terumah of the mishkan (the tabernacle), an individual gift. (The thirteen articles mentioned below were needed either for the work of the mishkan or for the priestly garments)].
25:3	And this is the terumah that you shall take from them: gold, silver, and copper [all voluntary gifts, except silver, a half-shekel for each individual (Additional offerings of silver were used for making the ministering vessels)].
25:4	And tcheleth [wool died with the blood of the chilazon, of a greenish hue], and argaman [wool colored with a dye of that name], and crimson, and linen, and goats' hair.
25:5	And skins of rams dyed red [after tanning] and skins of techashim [a kind of animal found only at that time], and acacia wood. [Jacob foresaw that they would build a tabernacle in the desert (where there is no wood). Accordingly, he brought cedars to Egypt, planted them and bade his sons take them when they left Egypt.]
25:6	Oil for the light [pure olive oil to make the flame ascend continuously], spices for the anointing oil [used to anoint the vessels of the mishkan itself, to sanctify it] and for the burning [ketoreth (the rising of a smoke column)] of the incense, [which was burned every evening and morning].
25:7	[Two] onyx stones [for the ephod (28:6)] and stones for filling [the golden settings in the breastplate (choshen)], for the ephod and the choshen [respectively].
25:8	And they shall make for Me mikdash [beth kedushah — "a house of holiness"] and I shall dwell in their midst.
25:9	["And they shall make for Me mikdash"] according to all that I show you, the design of the tabernacle and the design of all its vessels. And so [according to this design] shall you do [in future generations when any of the Temple vessels are lost].
25:10	And they shall make an ark [without legs] of acacia wood: two and a half cubits, its length; one and a half cubits, its breadth; and one and a half cubits, its height.
25:11	And you shall cover it with pure gold. From inside and from outside shall you cover it. [Bezalel made three arks: two of gold and one of wood, each having four walls and a base, and open from above. He placed the wooden one in a golden one, and a golden one in the wooden one and covered the top with gold so that it was found to be covered with gold "from inside and from outside."] And you shall make a rim of gold roundabout it. [He made the outer ark higher than the inner so that it projected above the kaporeth (the ark cover) and formed a rim roundabout, symbolizing the "crown of Torah"].
25:12	And you shall cast for it four golden rings, and you shall place them on its four [upper] corners [near the kaporeth, two on each side along the breadth of the ark, into which the staves were placed, this allowing space (the two and a half cubits of the length) for two carriers to walk between them] — two rings on one side and two rings on the other.
25:13	And you shall make staves of acacia wood and cover them with gold.
25:14	And you shall insert the staves in the rings on the sides of the ark to carry the ark therewith.
25:15	In the rings of the ark shall the staves remain; they shall never depart from it.
25:16	And you shall place in the ark the Testimony [(the Torah, which serves as testimony between you and Me that I have charged you with the mitzvoth written therein)] that I shall give you.
25:17	And you shall make a kaporeth [an ark-cover (the ark was open on top and the kaporeth was placed upon it like a board)] of pure gold: two and a half cubits its length and a cubit and a half its width [(corresponding to the length and width of the ark, the kaporeth resting on the thickness of its four walls. The thickness of the kaporeth was a tefach, a hand-breadth)].
25:18	And you shall make two golden cherubs. Of beaten work shall you make them, at the two [front] ends of the kaporeth.
25:19	Make one cherub at one end and one cherub at the other end. From the kaporeth [itself] shall you make the cherubs at its two ends.
25:20	And the cherubs shall have their wings spread on high [parallel to their heads], covering the kaporeth with their wings from above [a space of ten tefachim between the wings and the kaporeth]. And their faces shall be towards each other. Towards the kaporeth shall the faces of the cherubs be.
25:21	And you shall place the kaporeth on the ark from above, and in the ark shall you place the Testimony that I shall give you.
25:22	And I will be appointed for you [to speak to you] there, and I will speak to you from above the kaporeth between the two cherubs on the ark of testimony, all that I shall charge you with to the children of Israel.
25:23	And you shall make a table of acacia wood: two cubits, its length; one cubit, its breadth; and a cubit and a half, its height [the combined height of its legs and the thickness of the table].
25:24	And you shall cover it with pure gold, and you shall make for it a rim of gold roundabout, [symbolizing the "crown of kingdom"].
25:25	And you shall make a frame for it, a hand-breadth roundabout, and you shall make a golden rim [the aforementioned (24)] for its frame, roundabout.
25:26	And you shall make for it four golden rings, and you shall place the rings in the four corners of its four legs.
25:27	Opposite the [corners of the] frame shall the rings be, as housings for the staves for the carrying of the table.
25:28	And you shall make the staves of acacia wood, and you shall cover them with gold, and the table shall be carried with them.
25:29	And you shall make its [bread-] moulds [for the show-bread], its censers [for the frankincense], its (hollow) canes [canes split lengthwise on which the loaves were placed to separate one from another so that they not mold], and its staves, [the framework for the canes] by which [canes] it [the show-bread] shall be covered. Of pure gold shall you make them.
25:30	And you shall place upon the table show-bread before Me always. ["show-bread," lit., "face-bread," so called because it had "faces" (i.e., surfaces) facing two (opposite) sides of the sanctuary].
25:31	And you shall make a menorah [candelabrum] of pure gold; of beaten work shall the menorah be made, ["of itself." Moses being "stymied" by the task, the Holy One Blessed be He said to him: "Cast the talent into the fire and it shall be made of itself."] Its base, its [central] shaft [surmounted by the middle lamp, made in the form of a cup (for the oil and the wick)], its bowls [golden ornaments projecting from the branches], its bulbs [apple-shaped ornaments around the central branch], and its flowers [flower-shaped figures], from it [the one piece of gold] shall be [fashioned (without breaking anything off)].
25:32	And six branches projecting from its [the central shaft's] sides, three branches of the menorah from one side, and three branches of the menorah from the other side [slantwise, one above the other, all rising to the height of the middle branch].
25:33	Three chased bowls on one branch, with bulb and flower; and three chased bowls on the other branch, with bulb and flower. And so with (all) six branches that project from the menorah.
25:34	And on the [central shaft of the] menorah were four bowls [one projecting under the branches, and three (respectively) above the origin of the branches], chased, its bulbs and its flowers [(The phrase is ambiguous, i.e., either "bowls chased, its bulbs and its flowers," or "…bowls, its bulbs and its flowers chased")]
25:35	And a bulb under the two branches from it [the one piece of gold], and a bulb under the (next) two branches from it, and a bulb under the (next) two branches from it, (thus) for (all) the six branches that project from the menorah.
25:36	Their bulbs and their branches from it shall be, all one (piece of) beaten work of pure gold.
25:37	And you shall make its lamps [small bowls into which oil and wicks were placed], seven, and he (the artificer) shall fashion its lamps so that their light is directed at its face [the central shaft].
25:38	And its tongs [for manipulating and positioning the wicks] and its snuff-dishes [small bowls into which the high-priest raked the ashes every morning], pure gold.
25:39	(Of) a talent of pure gold shall he make it [together] with all these vessels.
25:40	And see, and make (them) according to their design which you are shown [here] in the mountain.
26
26:1	And the tabernacle (the mishkan) shall you make with ten curtains [to serve it as a roof and as partitions outside the boards, the curtains being hung behind them to cover them]: twisted linen (shesh) and blue (wool) and purple and scarlet, [four varieties in each thread, one of linen and three of wool and each thread twisted six (shesh) times, giving a twenty-four-fold thread], cherubs of artistic work [(figures interwoven on both sides)] shall you make them.
26:2	The length of one curtain, twenty-eight cubits; and the width, four cubits for one curtain — one measure for all the curtains.
26:3	Five curtains shall be attached [by sewing] one to the other, and five curtains, one to the other.
26:4	And you shall make loops of purple wool at the edge of the end curtain of one (five-curtain) joining, and, likewise, at the edge of the end curtain of the other joining.
26:5	Fifty loops shall you make in the one (end) curtain, and fifty loops shall you make at the edge of the (end) curtain in the second joining, the loops [on the respective joinings] directly aligned one with the other.
26:6	And you shall make fifty golden hooks, and you shall join the curtains one to the other by the hooks, [inserting one end of the hook into one loop, and the other end, into its corresponding loop], and the tabernacle shall be one.
26:7	And you shall make curtains of goats' hair to tent over the [lower curtains of the] tabernacle; eleven curtains shall you make them.

26:14	And you shall make a cover for the tent [(the goats' hair roof)] of rams' skins dyed red, and a cover of tachash skins above.
26:15	And you shall make the beams of the tabernacle [those that have been designated for the purpose (Jacob, prophetically, having planted acacia trees to this end)] of standing acacia wood. [The beams of the tabernacle walls are to be stood up vertically, and not placed horizontally one atop the other.]
26:16	Ten cubits the length of the beam [(so that the height of the tabernacle was ten cubits)], and a cubit and a half the breadth of each beam [(so that the length of the tabernacle was thirty cubits)].
26:17	Two prongs (wooden projections) for each beam [(the beam being hollowed out at the bottom to form these prongs)], rung-like, one near the other [like the rungs of a ladder]. So shall you do for all the beams of the tabernacle.
26:18	And you shall make the beams for the tabernacle, twenty beams for the southern side.
26:19	And forty silver sockets shall you make under the twenty beams; two sockets under one beam for its two prongs, and two sockets under the next beam for its two prongs.
26:20	And for the second side of the tabernacle, the northern side, twenty beams.
26:21	And their forty silver sockets, two sockets under one beam and two sockets under the next beam.
26:22	And for the ends [i.e., the back] of the tabernacle on the west, you shall make six beams, [accounting for nine cubits of width.]

26:24	And they (the beams) shall be fitted against each other at the bottom, and together shall they be fitted at its top into one ring. [Two adjacent beams were fixed together by a ring placed in grooves along their breadth.] So shall it be for the two of them [for the two beams at the end, the beam at the northern end and the western beam, and so,] for the two corners shall they be.
26:25	And [on the western side] there shall be eight beams and their silver sockets, sixteen sockets; two sockets under one beam and two sockets under the next beam.
26:26	And you shall make bars of acacia wood, five for the beams of one side of the tabernacle [These "five" are three, the upper and lower bars, respectively, consisting of two equal (fifteen cubit segments) running along the side wall, and one bar running the entire length through a hole bored in each beam.]
26:27	And five bars for the beams of the second side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the beams of the side of the tabernacle at the western ends.
26:28	And the middle bar in the midst of the beams shall extend from end to end.
26:29	And the beams shall you cover with gold, and their rings shall you make of gold [to serve as] housings for the bars, and you shall cover the bars with gold [i.e., They will be "covered" with gold when they are inserted into the golden rings flanked by the golden half-reeds on either side.]
26:30	And you shall set up the tabernacle after the manner which will have been shown to you [by the L rd] in the mountain.

26:32	And you shall place it on four pillars of acacia wood covered with gold, their hooks of gold [(Hooks bent upwards were set in the pillars on which to place the pole on which the top of the parocheth was wrapped)] (the pillars standing) upon four sockets of silver.
26:33	And you shall put the parocheth under the hooks, and you shall bring there, inside the parocheth, the ark of testimony; and the parocheth shall separate for you between the holy and the holy of holies.
26:34	And you shall put the kaporeth (the lid) upon the ark of testimony in the holy of holies.

26:36	And you shall make a screen [a curtain] for the entrance of the tent, of blue wool, purple wool, scarlet wool, and twisted linen, the work of an embroiderer [needlework, the figures on one side being the same as those on the other.]
26:37	And you shall make for the screen five pillars of acacia wood, and you shall cover them with gold, and their hooks (shall be) of gold; and you shall cast for them five copper sockets.
27
27:1	And you shall make the altar of acacia wood, five cubits long and five cubits wide. The altar shall be square and three cubits high.
27:2	And you shall make its horns on its four corners. From it [the altar itself] shall its horns be, [and not first made and then attached to it.] and you shall cover it with copper [to atone for brazenness (see Isaiah 48:4)].
27:3	And you shall make its pots (into which) to empty its ashes, and its shovels [with which to remove its ashes], and its sprinkling basins [in which to receive the blood of the sacrifices], and its spits, and its fire-pans [for taking coals from the outer altar to the inner altar for the burning of the incense]. All of its implements shall you make of copper.
27:4	And you shall make for it a copper lattice, netting work. And you shall make on the netting four copper rings at its four edges.
27:5	And you shall place it under the karkov of the altar [an encircling, decorative band] below. And the netting shall extend until the mid-point of the altar [for distinguishing between the (placing of the) "upper blood" and the "lower blood"].
27:6	And you shall make staves for the altar of acacia wood, and you shall cover them with copper.
27:7	And its staves shall be brought into the [four] rings [made in the lattice]. And the staves shall be on the two sides of the altar when it is carried.
27:8	A hollow of boards shall you make it, as He showed you on the mountain; so shall they do.
27:9	And you shall make the court of the tabernacle: On the south side, curtains for the court, of twisted linen, a hundred cubits long on one side.

Tetzaveh
27:20	And you shall command the children of Israel that they take for you olive oil, clear [without lees], (the olives) crushed [(in a mortar and not ground in a mill, so that there be no lees)], for illumination [(but the olives may be ground in a mill for the (oil of the) meal-offering)], to raise a light [(the flame rising of itself)] continually [i.e., each night].
27:21	In the tent of meeting outside the parocheth which is before the Testimony, Aaron and his sons shall arrange it [so that it burn] from evening until morning before the L rd, an eternal statute for their generations, from the children of Israel.
28
28:1	And you, draw near to yourself [after completing the work of the tabernacle] Aaron your brother and his sons with him from the midst of the children of Israel to be a priest unto Me — Aaron, Nadav and Avihu, Elazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron.
28:2	And you shall make consecrated garments for Aaron your brother, for honor and for glory.
28:3	And you shall speak to all the wise of heart whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they make the vestments of Aaron to sanctify him, to make him a Cohein [a ministering priest] unto Me.
28:4	And these are the garments which they shall make: a choshen [an ornament worn on the heart], an ephod [a kind of apron], a me'il [an outer robe], a kethoneth [an inner robe worn on the skin] with checkered indentations, a mitznefeth [a dome-like hat], and an avnet [the belt over the kethoneth]. And they shall make garments of kodesh [i.e., from the contribution that has been consecrated (mekudesheth) for My name] for Aaron your brother and for his sons to make him a Cohein unto Me.
28:5	And they [the wise of heart] shall take [from the donors] the gold, the blue wool, the purple wool, the scarlet wool, and the linen [whereof to make the garments].
28:6	And they shall make the ephod of gold, blue wool, purple wool, scarlet wool, and twisted linen, artistic work. [See Rashi on 26:1.]
28:7	Two shoulder straps, attached, shall it [the ephod] have to its two ends [(to the ends of the width of the ephod, which is the width of the Cohein's back)], and it [the ephod with the two shoulder straps] shall be connected [to the cheishev (8) (by needle, and not woven together with it)].
28:8	And the cheishev [the belt] of his adornment which is above it [i.e., which is on the upper edge of the ephod], after its manner [i.e., artistic work, of the five varieties (of material)], of it [i.e., woven together with the ephod] shall it be: gold, blue wool, purple wool, scarlet wool, and twisted linen.
28:9	And you shall take the two shoham stones and engrave thereon the names of the children of Israel.
28:10	Six of their names on the one stone, and the names of the remaining six on the second stone, in order of their birth [i.e., on the first stone: Reuven, Shimon, Levi, Yehudah, Dan, Naftali; on the second: Gad, Asher, Yissachar, Zevulun, Yosef, Binyamin].
28:11	The work of a stone artisan (a lapidary), [with script as clear as] the engraving of a signet shall you engrave the two stones with the names of the children of Israel; surrounded by golden settings shall you make them [(the settings then to be attached to the shoulder straps of the ephod)].
28:12	And you shall place the two stones on the shoulder straps of the ephod, stones of remembrance for the children of Israel. And Aaron shall carry their names before the L rd on his two shoulders as a remembrance [i.e., so that the Holy One see the tribes inscribed before Him and remember their righteousness].
28:13	And you shall make [two] golden settings.
28:14	And (you shall make) two chains of pure gold. At the edge [of the choshen] shall you make them, braided chains on the settings [of the ephod].
28:15	And you shall make a choshen of judgment [i.e., a choshen which atones for subversion of judgment]; artistic work, like the work of the ephod shall you make it: gold, blue wool, purple wool, scarlet wool, and twisted linen shall you make it.
28:16	Square shall it be, folded (into a square), a zereth (half a cubit) its length, and a zereth its width.
28:17	And you shall fill it [its indentations] with stone filling, four rows of stone. A row of odem, pitedah, and bareketh — the one row.
28:18	The second row — nofech, sapir, and yahalom.
28:19	The third row — leshem, shevo, and achlamah.
28:20	And the fourth row — tarshish, shoham, and yashfeh. Set in gold shall they [the rows] be with their [exact] fillings [i.e., They shall be surrounded by golden settings of a depth to accommodate the exact thickness of the stone.]
28:21	And the stones shall be according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engraving of a signet, each by his name shall they be, for the twelve tribes [in order of their birth: odem for Reuven, pitedah for Shimon, etc.]
28:22	And you shall make for the choshen chains at the edge, braidwork of pure gold.
28:23	And you shall make for the choshen two rings of gold, and you shall put the two rings on the two ends of the choshen [on the two corners opposite the neck.]
28:24	And you shall place the two golden braids on the two rings at the ends of the choshen.
28:25	And the two ends of the two braids [i.e., the two heads of each braid] you shall place on the two settings (verses 12-13) [the right braid on the right setting, and the left braid on the left], and you shall place [the settings] on the shoulder straps of the ephod on its face [i.e., on the topside of the (shoulder strap of the) ephod.]
28:26	And you shall make two golden rings, and you shall place them on the two ends of the choshen [the two lower corners] on its edge which faces the ephod [i.e., the lower, apron part], inwards [(whereas the rings on top of the choshen face outwards)].
28:27	And you shall make two golden rings, and you shall place them on the (origin of the) two shoulder straps of the ephod below, on its face [i.e., on the topside of the ephod], opposite [i.e., near] where it [the shoulder strap] is attached [to the ephod], above the cheishev of the ephod.
28:28	And they shall bind the choshen from its rings to the rings of the ephod with a string of blue wool to be on [i.e., fastened to] the cheishev of the ephod. And the choshen shall not be detached from the ephod.
28:29	And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel on the choshen of judgment on his heart when he enters the sanctuary, as a remembrance before the L rd, always.
28:30	And you shall place into the [fold of the] choshen of judgment, the urim and the tumim [the (written) Tetragrammaton, by means of which the choshen illuminates (meir) and brings to perfection (metamem) its words]. And they shall be on Aaron's heart when he comes before the L rd. And Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel [(i.e., the choshen, which they consult for judgment and direction)] on his heart before the L rd, always.
28:31	And you shall make the me'il (the outer robe) of the ephod [i.e., belted by the ephod] entirely of blue wool.
28:32	And its head-opening shall be [folded over] within it [as a hem]. Its opening shall have a border roundabout, the work of a weaver [and not needlework]. As the opening of a suit of armor shall it [its neck-opening] be for it, so that it not be torn [(Tearing it constitutes transgression of a negative commandment.]
28:33	And you shall make on its (lower) hem pomegranates [(they were round and hollow)] of blue wool and purple wool and scarlet wool on its hem roundabout, and golden bells [with clappers within them] in their [the pomegranates'] midst roundabout, [one bell between every two pomegranates].
28:34	A golden bell and a pomegranate [next to it], a golden bell and a pomegranate on the hem of the me'il roundabout.
28:35	And it will be on Aaron for ministering, and its sound will be heard when he comes to the sanctuary before the L rd and when he leaves, and he will not die [(the implication being that if he enters lacking one of the priestly garments he is subject to death at the hands of Heaven)].
28:36	And you shall make a tzitz [a kind of plate, two fingerbreadths wide, which went round his forehead from ear to ear], of pure gold, and you shall engrave it as the engraving of a signet: "Holy to the L rd."
28:37	And you shall place it on a string of blue wool, and it [the middle string of three (two at the sides and one in the middle)] shall be on the mitznefeth (the mitre). Opposite the face of [i.e., on top of] the mitznefeth shall it be.
28:38	And it [the tzitz] shall be on Aaron's forehead. And Aaron shall bear [(towards atonement)] the sin of the holy (offerings) which the children of Israel consecrate of all the gifts of their holy offerings [(the tzitz atones for offerings of impure blood and fats)]. And it shall be on his forehead [to atone for them] always, for (the conferring of) favor upon them before the L rd.
28:39	And you shall checker [with indentations] the kethoneth (the inner robe) [which is made of] linen. And you shall make a mitznefeth of linen; and an avneit (a belt) shall you make, the work of an embroiderer.
28:40	And for the sons of Aaron you shall make [(these four garments, including michnasayim (42), and no more:)] kutanoth; and you shall make for them avneitim; and migbaoth [mitznafoth] shall you make for them for honor and for glory.
28:41	And you shall dress with them [the eight garments] Aaron your brother, and [with the four garments] his sons with him, and you shall anoint them [Aaron and his sons (with the anointing oil)], and you shall fill their hands [i.e., you shall invest them], and you shall sanctify them, and they shall minister unto Me.
28:42	And you shall make for them [for Aaron and for his sons] pants (michnasayim) of linen to cover the flesh of nakedness. From the hips to the thighs shall they be.
28:43	And they [their respective garments] shall be on Aaron and on his sons when they come to the tent of meeting [to the heichal (Temple); likewise, to the mishkan (tabernacle)] or when they draw near to the altar to serve in holiness, that they not bear a sin and die [ — whence it is derived that a Cohein who ministers lacking one of the priestly garments incurs death (at the hands of Heaven)], an eternal statute [categorical (for validity of the service) immediately and for future generations], for him and for his seed after him.
29
29:1	And this is the thing that you shall do to them to sanctify them to minister unto Me: Take one young bullock [to atone for the sin of the golden calf (that "calf" being a bullock)] and two unblemished rams.
29:2	And [(ten of each of the following kinds:)] matzah bread [(later referred to as "challah of oil bread" (23) because he puts as much oil into it as into the loaves and wafers combined)], and matzah challoth mixed with oil [when they are still flour], and matzah wafers anointed with oil. [After they are baked, he anoints them in the shape of the Greek letter chi, similar to our nun.] Of fine wheat flour shall you make them.
29:3	And you shall place them in one basket, and you shall bring them near in the basket [to the court of the mishkan on the day it is erected], and the bullock and the two rams.
29:4	And Aaron and his sons you shall bring near to the entrance of the tent of meeting, and you shall wash them in water [(This is immersion of the entire body)].
29:5	And you shall take the garments and you shall dress Aaron with the kutoneth and the me'il of the ephod and the ephod and the choshen. And you shall adorn him with the cheishev of the ephod.
29:6	And you shall place the mitznefeth on his head, and you shall place the crown of sanctity [the tzitz] on the mitznefeth. [See 28:37].
29:7	And you shall take the oil of anointment, and you shall pour it on his head, and you shall anoint him.
29:8	And his sons shall you bring near and dress them in kutanoth.
29:9	And you shall gird them with an avneit, Aaron and his sons, and you shall bind migbaoth upon them, and the kehunah (the priesthood) shall be for them an everlasting statute; and you shall fill the hand of Aaron and the hand of his sons. [i.e., You shall thereby invest them into the priesthood.]
29:10	And you shall bring the bullock before the tent of meeting, and Aaron and his sons shall place their hands on the head of the bullock.
29:11	And you shall slaughter the bullock before the L rd at the entrance of the tent of meeting [i.e., in the court of the mishkan before the entrance].
29:12	And you shall take of the blood of the bullock and you shall place it on [top of] the horns of the altar with your finger, and all of the [remnants of the] blood you shall pour at the base of the altar.
29:13	And you shall take all of the fat that covers the innards [i.e., the stomach membrane] and the lobe [the liver membrane] with [some of] the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat that is upon them, and you shall smoke (them) upon the altar.
29:14	And the flesh of the bullock and its hide and its waste you shall burn in a fire outside the camp — it is a sin-offering [This is the only outer-altar sin-offering which is (entirely) burnt].
29:15	And you shall take the one ram and Aaron and his sons shall place their hands on the head of the ram.
29:16	And you shall slaughter the ram and you shall take its blood and you shall toss it [from a vessel] on the [corners of the] altar [so that the blood is seen on both sides of each corner] roundabout. [He tosses it on two opposite diagonal corners, so that the blood is seen on all four sides of the altar.]
29:17	And you shall cut the ram into its pieces, and you shall wash its innards and its feet, and you shall place them with its [other] pieces and with its head.
29:18	And you shall smoke the entire ram upon the altar. It is a burnt-offering to the L rd, a fragrance that is pleasing [in that His will was done], a fire-offering [i.e., the smoking of the limbs on the fire] to the L rd.
29:19	And you shall take the second ram, and Aaron and his sons shall place their hands on the head of the ram.
29:20	And you shall slaughter the ram, and you shall take of its blood and you shall place it on the t'nuch of the ear [the cartilage of the middle section inside the ear] of Aaron, and on the t'nuch of the ear of his sons — the right (ear) — and on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot. And you shall toss the blood on the altar roundabout.
29:21	And you shall take some of the blood which is on the altar and some of the anointment oil, and you shall sprinkle it upon Aaron and upon his garments and upon his sons and upon the garments of his sons with him. And he and his garments and his sons and the garments of his sons with him shall be sanctified.
29:22	And you shall take from the ram the fat [of the small intestines, or (according to another opinion) the stomach], and the fat-tail, [from the kidneys and below], and the fat that covers the innards, and the lobe with [some of] the liver and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them and the right thigh [(This is the only instance of the smoking of the right thigh with the eimurim [the consecrated parts])]; for it is the ram of miluim (completeness) [a peace-offering (shelamim), complete in that all share in it: the altar, the officiator (in this instance, Moses, who receives the breast), and the owners (in this instance, Aaron and his sons, who eat the rest of it)].
29:23	And one loaf of bread [from the (matzah) challoth (see 2)], and one challah of oil bread, and one wafer from the basket of matzoth which is before the L rd. [(This is the only instance of a bread offering accompanying an animal offering, being burned on the altar)].
29:24	And you shall place all of it on the palms of Aaron and on the palms of his sons, and you shall wave them a waving before the L rd. [The Cohein (in this instance, Moses) places his hand under that of the owner (in this instance, Aaron and his sons, who held the parts), and he moves them back and forth (to the Owner of the four winds of the world). Waving staves off punishment and ill winds. In "lifting" (27), he lifts and lowers them (to the Owner of heaven and earth). Lifting staves off harmful dews.]
29:25	And you shall take them from their hand and you shall smoke them on the altar after the [first ram which you brought as a] burnt-offering, a pleasing fragrance before the L rd. It is a fire-offering to the L rd [i.e., in His name].
29:26	And you shall take the breast of the ram of miluim which is Aaron's, and you shall wave it, a waving before the L rd, and it shall be a portion for you.
29:27	And you shall consecrate [for waving and lifting in peace-offerings of future generations] the breast of the waving and the thigh of the lifting, which was waved and which was lifted, from the ram of the miluim which is Aaron's and his sons'.
29:28	[But you shall not consecrate it for burning in future generations, for] it shall be for Aaron and his sons as an everlasting share from the children of Israel [to whom the peace-offerings belong]. For it [breast and thigh] is a devotion. And it shall be set aside by the children of Israel from the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, their devotion to the L rd.
29:29	And the consecrated garments which are Aaron's shall be to his sons [of the high-priesthood] after him, to be exalted through them and to be invested [in the high-priesthood] through them.
29:30	Seven [consecutive] days shall he don them, he who officiates in his stead, of his sons, who comes to the tent of meeting [i.e., who is qualified to enter the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur, viz. the high-priest], to minister in the holy place.
29:31	And the miluim ram shall you take and you shall cook its flesh in a holy place [i.e., in the court of the tent of meeting, these peace-offerings being holy of holies].
29:32	And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram and the bread that is in the basket at the entrance [i.e., in the court] of the tent of meeting.
29:33	And they [Aaron and his sons, the owners,] shall eat them, so that there be atoned through them [any impurity they (Aaron and his sons) possess], to invest them [through the ram and the bread] and to consecrate them [in the priesthood]. And a stranger (i.e., a non-Cohein) may not eat, for they are holy [i.e., holy of holies (whence is derived the exhortation against a non-Cohein eating holy of holies)].
29:34	And if anything be left over from the flesh of the miluim or from the bread until morning, you shall burn what is left over in fire. It shall not be eaten, for it is consecrated.
29:35	And you shall do thus to Aaron and to his sons, according to everything I have commanded you [(The repetition renders the commandment categorical, so that if even one detail is omitted they are not invested.)] Seven days [i.e., on each of the seven days] shall you invest them [as indicated].
29:36	And a bullock sin-offering shall you make each day for the cleansings [of the altar of any impurity], and you shall purify the altar [by application of blood with the finger] when you cleanse it. And you shall anoint it [with the anointing oil] to consecrate it.
29:37	Seven days shall you cleanse the altar and you shall consecrate it. And the altar shall be holy of holies [in that] whatever touches the altar [(even an unfit offering)] shall be consecrated.
29:38	And this is what you shall offer upon the altar [("this": something like the burnt-offering which follows, i.e., an animal which was fit when it entered the Temple court — even if it became unfit thereafter. Such animals (but not those which were unfit before they entered), once they ascend the altar are not taken down)]: sheep in their first year, two each day, always.
29:39	The one sheep shall you offer in the morning and the second sheep shall you offer in the afternoon.
29:40	And a tenth of [an ephah of] fine flour mixed with oil of crushing [i.e., extracted by crushing olives in a mortar (although it is also valid if the olives are ground in a mill. See 27:20)], a quarter of a hin; and a libation, a quarter of a hin of wine, for the one sheep.
29:41	And the second sheep shall you offer in the afternoon. As the meal-offering of the morning and as its libation shall you offer it, a pleasing fragrance [(this, referring to the libation meal-offering, which is entirely burnt)], a fire-offering to the L rd.
29:42	A continual [daily] burnt-offering for your generations, at the entrance of the tent of meeting before the L rd, where I shall appoint a time for you to speak to you [i.e., When I set a time to speak with you, I shall set it for that place.]
29:43	And I shall be appointed there for the children of Israel [to speak to them], and it [the mishkan] will be sanctified through My glory, [My shechinah resting therein.]
29:44	And I shall consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar; and Aaron and his sons shall I consecrate to minister unto Me.
29:45	And I shall dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and I shall be a G d to them.
29:46	And they shall know that I am the L rd their G d who took them out of the land of Egypt so that I should dwell in their midst; I am the L rd their G d.
30
30:1	And you shall make an altar for the smoking of the spices; of acacia wood shall you make it.
30:2	A cubit its length and a cubit its width — square shall it be; and two cubits its height. From it shall its horns be (made).
30:3	And you shall cover it with pure gold, its roof and its walls roundabout and its horns; and you shall make for it a rim of gold roundabout [symbolizing "the crown of kehunah"].
30:4	And two golden rings shall you make for it. Beneath its rim at its two corners shall you make (them), on its two sides. And it [the ring-work] shall be for housings for the staves to carry it thereby.
30:5	And you shall make the staves of acacia wood, and you shall cover them with gold.
30:6	And you shall place it before the parocheth which is by the ark of testimony, before the lid on the testimony [i.e., aligned directly opposite the ark, on the outside of the parocheth], where I shall be appointed for you.
30:7	And Aaron shall smoke incense upon it every morning. When he cleans the lamps [the cups of the menorah (He would clean them of their ashes every morning)], he shall smoke it.
30:8	And when Aaron kindles the lamps in the afternoon, he shall smoke it, [every day, half a portion in the morning, half in the afternoon], a continual incense before the L rd for your generations.
30:9	You shall not bring up upon it strange [i.e., donated] incense, nor burnt-offering [any offering of animal or fowl], nor meal-offering [any offering of bread]; nor may you pour a libation upon it.
30:10	And Aaron will make atonement [by application of the blood] upon its horns once a year [on Yom Kippur] with the blood of the sin-offering of the atonements [the bullock and the goat of Yom Kippur, which atone for impurity of the sanctuary and its sacred objects]. Once a year shall he make atonement upon it for your generations; it is holy of holies to the L rd [It is consecrated for these things alone and for no other service.]
Ki Tissa
30:11	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
30:12	When you [wish to] take [a count of] the heads of the children of Israel according to their numbers, [do not count them by heads, but] let each man give [a half-shekel] as an atonement for his soul to the L rd in counting them, so that there be no plague among them in counting them. [And count the shekalim, for the evil eye prevails over what is counted and makes it vulnerable to pestilence (See II Samuel 24:1-10)].
30:13	This is what they shall give [(The L rd showed Moses a coin of fire whose weight was half a shekel and said to him: "Let them give a coin like this")], everyone who passes among the counted, half a shekel by the [standard] shekel [weight] for consecration, twenty gerah the shekel. [Let them give] half this shekel as an offering to the L rd.
30:14	Everyone who passes among the counted, from the age of twenty years and above [(the army age)] shall give the offering of the L rd.
30:15	The rich shall not give more and the poor shall not give less than the half-shekel, to give the offering of the L rd to atone for your souls [i.e., so that you not be plague-smitten because of the count.]
30:16	And you shall take the silver of the atonements from the children of Israel and give it for the work of the tent of meeting [(whence it is seen that Moses was commanded to count them at the beginning of the erection of the mishkan. It was from this counting that the sockets for the mishkan were made.)] And it shall be for the children of Israel a remembrance before the L rd to atone for your souls.
30:17	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
30:18	And you shall make a kiyyor [an urn with spigots] of copper, and its pedestal of copper, for washing. And you shall place it between the tent of meeting and the altar [(not directly between them but drawn off towards the south)], and you shall put water there.
30:19	And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet from it [(at one and the same time, placing the right hand on the right foot and the left hand on the left foot.)]
30:20	When they come to the tent of meeting [to smoke incense morning and evening, or to sprinkle of the blood of the bullock of the high-priest and the "idolatry goats"], they shall wash with water and they will not die, [(the implication being that if they do not wash they will die], or when they draw near to the [outer] altar to serve, to smoke a fire-offering to the L rd.
30:21	And they shall wash their hands and feet and not die, [the implication being that if they do not wash (this, in reference to service on the outer altar) they will die]. And it shall be for them an eternal statute, for him and his seed for their generations.
30:22	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
30:23	And you, take for yourself choice spices: pure myrrh, five hundred (shekel-weights)]; aromatic cinnamon — half of it, two hundred and fifty [(It was weighed twice to amount to five hundred and a little more (a small amount being added each time to tip the scale above 250)]; and aromatic cane, two hundred and fifty [(its total weight)].
30:24	And kiddah, five hundred in the shekel-weight of the sanctuary, and a hin of olive oil.
30:25	And you shall make of it oil of sacred anointment, a mixed blend, the work of the spice-blender. Oil of sacred anointment shall it be.
30:26	And you shall anoint with it [(in the shape of the Greek letter chi)] the tent of meeting and the ark of testimony.
30:27	And the table and all of its implements, the menorah and all of its implements, and the incense altar.
30:28	And the burnt-offering altar and all of its implements, and the kiyyor and its pedestal.
30:29	And [by this anointment] you shall consecrate them and they shall be holy of holies [in that] everything [fit for (use in) a ministering vessel] that touches them [i.e., that enters into them] shall become consecrated.
30:30	And Aaron and his sons shall you anoint, and you shall consecrate them to minister unto Me.
30:31	And to the children of Israel shall you speak, saying: Oil of sacred anointment shall this (zeh) be to Me [(The gematria of zeh is twelve; there were twelve lugin of anointing oil)], for your generations [All of it remains for future generations.]
30:32	On the flesh of man it shall not be smeared, and you shall not compound another like it. It is holy. Holy shall it be to you.
30:33	One who compounds its like or who puts of it [(of that made by Moses)] upon a stranger [(one not requiring anointment for priesthood or royalty)] shall be cut off from his people.
30:34	And the L rd said to Moses: Take for yourself [two] spices [and] stacte, onycha, galbanum [(a foul-smelling spice, included in the incense to teach us not to belittle inclusion of sinners in our fasts and prayers)], [and an additional five] spices, and pure frankincense. They [the stacte, onycha, galbanum, and frankincense] shall be equal [in weight] to one another.
30:35	And you shall make it into incense, a compound, the work of a spice-blender, thoroughly mixed, [and it shall be] pure [and] holy.
30:36	And you shall grind some of it fine, and you shall place some of it [daily, on the inner altar] before the [ark of] testimony in the tent of meeting where I shall be appointed for you [to speak to you] there. Holy of holies shall it be to you.
30:37	And the incense that you make, in its composition [(the number of its spices)] you shall not make for yourselves. Holy shall it be to you for the L rd. [You shall make it only for His name alone.]
30:38	One who makes its like to smell it shall be cut off from his people. [But one may make it of what he owns, in its composition, for Temple use.]
31
31:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
31:2	See, I have called by name [to do My work] Betzalel the son of Uri the son of Chur of the tribe of Judah.
31:3	And I have filled him with the spirit of G d, with wisdom [to learn from others], with understanding [to learn from what he has learned], with knowledge [the holy spirit], and with (skill in) all work.
31:4	To do [the] artistic work [of a weaver], to work in gold, silver, and copper.
31:5	And in stone work, to fill [the stone into its setting], and in wood work, to do all (kinds of) work.
31:6	And I, behold, I have placed with him Ahaliav the son of Achisamach of the tribe of Dan. And in the heart of all the wise of heart [who are among you] I have placed wisdom, and they shall make all that I have commanded you:
31:7	The tent of meeting and the ark for the [tablets of the] testimony, and the lid that is on it and all the implements of the tent.
31:8	And the table and its implements, and the menorah [made of] pure [gold], and all its implements, and the incense altar.
31:9	And the burnt-offering altar and all its implements, and the kiyyor, and its pedestal.
31:10	And the mesh vestments [see Numbers 4] and the consecrated garments of Aaron the Cohein, and the garments of his sons for ministering.
31:11	And the anointing oil, and the spice incense for [smoking in the sanctuary, which is] holy. As all that I have commanded you shall they make.
31:12	And the L rd said to Moses, saying:
31:13	And you, speak to the children of Israel, saying […Even though I commanded you to charge them concerning the work of the mishkan, do not make light of the Sabbath to override it by that work], but [though you be eager and zealous in that work], My Sabbaths shall you keep. For it is a [great] sign between Me and you for your generations [that I chose you, by bequeathing to you My day of rest for your rest], [for the nations] to know that I, the L rd, sanctify you.
31:14	And you shall keep the Sabbath, for it is holy to you. Those who profane it, [treating it like a weekday] shall be put to death [(if there were witnesses and warning)]. For whoever does work upon it, that soul [(in the absence of warning)] shall be cut off from the midst of its people.
31:15	Six days may work be done, and on the seventh day (there shall be) a Sabbath of resting [(not merely casual resting, but complete resting, where all work, even for preparation of food, is forbidden)], holy unto the L rd, [the keeping of its sanctity being for His name and by His charge.] Whoever does work on the Sabbath day shall be put to death.
31:16	And the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath to observe the Sabbath for their generations, an eternal covenant.
31:17	Between Me and the children of Israel it is a sign forever. For six days the L rd made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He rested and [His spirit] was restored [(G d using human terms that can be "assimilated by the ear" (of flesh and blood)].
31:18	And He gave to Moses when He finished speaking with him [(the statutes and the judgments in Mishpatim)] on Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony, stone tablets written by the finger of G d. ["There is no 'earlier' and 'later' in the Torah" (This section is out of chronological order.) The incident of the golden calf preceded the charge to build the mishkan. For on the seventeenth of Tammuz the tablets were broken, and on Yom Kippur the L rd was reconciled with Israel. And the next day they began donating for the mishkan, which was erected on the first of Nissan.] ("when He finished (kechalotho) speaking with him") ["kechalotho" is written defective (without the vav). The Torah was given to Moses as a gift, as a bride (kallah) is given to a groom, for he could not (in the order of nature) have learned all of it in such a short time.] ("when He finished speaking with him") [Moses heard the halachah first from the L rd, and then they "reviewed" it together.] ("tablets" — luchoth) ["luchoth" is written defective (without the vav), intimating (in the Hebrew) that the tablets were identical.]
32
32:1	And the people saw that [(according to their reckoning — which was erroneous!)] Moses delayed in descending the mountain, and the people [the mixed multitude] rose up in a body upon Aaron and said to him: Arise, make for us gods who will go before us [(they desired many gods)], for this Moses [(Satan showed them an image of Moses being carried (as one dead) in the firmament of heaven)], the man, who brought us up from the land of Egypt [and guided us on the way], we do not know what has become of him, [and we need gods to guide us in his stead].
32:2	And Aaron said to them: Remove the golden rings that are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me. [Aaron reasoned that the women and children would be reluctant to part with their jewelry and that in the meantime Moses would descend (but the men did not wait and they removed their own jewelry)].
32:3	And all the people disburdened themselves of the golden rings that were in their ears and brought them to Aaron.
32:4	And he took it from their hands and he bound it in a scarf [and cast it into a crucible], and he made it [by agency of the sorcerers of the mixed multitude] into a molten calf, and they [the mixed multitude] said: These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.
32:5	And Aaron saw [that it had in it the spirit of life and that "Satan's act had succeeded," and he could not repel them completely], so he built an altar before it [as a "delaying tactic"] and Aaron called out and he said: "There will be a festival for the L rd tomorrow!" [Aaron expecting that Moses would appear before they could worship the golden calf, and that they would, indeed, serve the L rd.]
32:6	And they arose early the next day, [Satan rousing them], and they offered up burnt-offerings and presented peace-offerings, and the people sat to eat and drink, and they arose to make sport [i.e., to commit adultery and to kill. (Chur, Miriam's son, who rebuked them, was killed here.)]
32:7	And the L rd spoke [harshly] to Moses: Go, descend [from your greatness. I gave you greatness only for their sake (At that time Moses was banished by the Heavenly Court)], for your people [(the mixed multitude, that you proselytized of your own volition)] that you brought up from the land of Egypt, has wrought corruptly.
32:8	They have turned aside quickly from the way I commanded them. They have made for themselves a molten calf, and they have bowed down to it, and they have slaughtered to it, and they have said: These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.
32:9	And the L rd said to Moses: I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff-necked people [They turn the "hard part" (the back) of their neck to those who would rebuke them.]
32:10	And now, leave Me and let My wrath burn against them and I will annihilate them [(the L rd "hinting" to Moses that his praying for them can save them)], and I will make of you a great nation.
32:11	And Moses prayed before the L rd his G d, and he said: Why, O L rd, should Your anger burn against Your people whom you took out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a strong hand? [Does rancor not obtain only with one wise man vis-à-vis another? with one strong man vis-à-vis another?]
32:12	Why should Egypt say: "For evil did He take them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them from the face of the earth!" Turn from Your burning wrath and bethink Yourself [to turn to good] the evil [intended] for Your people.
32:13	Remember unto Abraham, Isaac, and Israel what You swore to them in You [i.e., by Your eternal essence (Abraham — (Genesis 22:16), Isaac — (Ibid. 26:3), Israel — (Ibid. 35:11)], and You said to them: I shall multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens, and all of this land of which I spoke, I shall give to your seed, and they shall inherit it forever.
32:14	And the L rd bethought Himself of the evil which He had intended for His people.
3:15	And Moses turned and descended from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets written [(miraculously) to be readable] on both sides; on this side and on that were they written.
32:16	And the tablets are the work of G d [Himself], and the writing is the writing of G d, inscribed on the tablets.
32:17	And Joshua heard the sound of the people in its clamor [(They were regaling and laughing)], and he said to Moses: "There is a sound of war in the camp."
32:18	And he (Moses) said: There is no sound of strength and there is no sound of weakness. An agonizing sound do I hear [i.e., a sound of blaspheming and vilifying that agonizes the soul of the hearer.]
32:19	And it was, when he drew near to the camp, that he saw the calf and dances, and Moses' wrath burned, and he cast the tablets from his hands, and he broke them at the foot of the mountain.
32:20	And he took the calf that they had made, and he burned it with fire, and he ground it until it was fine (dust), and he scattered it over the water, and he gave the children of Israel to drink [with the intent of testing them like sototh (women suspected of adultery (see Numbers 5:11-31). Three death penalties were adjudicated: Where there were witnesses and warning — death by the sword (viz. 27 below) as in the instance of ir hanidachath (a city the majority of whose inhabitants have gone astray after idolatry. See Deuteronomy 13:13-19); where there were witnesses, but not warning — death by plague (viz. 35 below); where there were neither witnesses nor warning — death by hydrokon, the waters "inspecting" them (as in the instance of the sotah's draught) and their stomachs bursting].
32:21	And Moses said to Aaron: What did this people do to you! [i.e., How much suffering must you have endured] so that you [not] bring upon it [this] great sin!
32:22	And Aaron said: Let my master's wrath not burn. You know the people, that it is [in a] bad [way, always "proving" the L rd.]
32:23	And they said to me: Make for us gods who will go before us, for this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.
32:24	And I said to them [(only) one thing]: "Who has gold?" [And] they [hurried and] disburdened themselves and gave it to me. And I cast it into the fire, [not knowing that this calf would emerge], and this calf emerged.
32:25	And Moses saw the people, that it was "exposed"; for Aaron had exposed it for scorn in [the mouths of] those rising up against them.
32:26	And Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and he said: "Whoever is for the L rd, [let him come] to me!" And there gathered unto him all the sons of Levi [(whence it is seen that the entire tribe was kasher)].
32:27	And he said to them: Thus said the L rd, the G d of Israel [(viz. 22:19): "He who slaughters to idolatry shall be put to death")]: Let every man put his sword on his thigh. Let him pass back and forth from gate to gate in the camp and kill; a man, his brother [by his mother (but not by his father, i.e., a non-Levite)], a man, his neighbor, and a man, his relative.
32:28	And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses, and there fell from the people on that day about three thousand men.
32:29	And Moses said: [You, who kill them,] fill your hands this day [i.e., By this you will be invested (see 28:41) to be Cohanim)] to the L rd. For each man [will be so invested (by having killed)] his son [i.e., his daughter's son by a non-Levite] and his brother [(as in 27)], to bestow upon you blessing this day.
32:30	And it was on the next day that Moses said to the people: You have committed a great sin. And now, I shall go up to the L rd. Perchance, I will shield you from your sin.
32:31	And Moses returned to the L rd and he said: I implore You — This people has committed a great sin, and they have made for themselves gods of gold [(If You had not lavished so much gold upon them, they would not have sinned)].
32:32	And now, if You will bear their sin, [good — do not erase me,] but if not, erase me, I pray You, from Your book that You have written [(Erase me from Your entire Torah, so that it not be said about me that I was not worthy enough to implore mercy for Israel.)]
32:33	And the L rd said to Moses: Whoever sinned against Me, him shall I erase from My book.
32:34	And now, go and lead the people whither I have spoken to you. Behold, my angel [ — but not I — ] shall go before you, and, [though I grant your petition not to destroy them outright,] on the day of My accounting [for other sins], I shall reckon their sin [of the golden calf] against them. ["No punishment comes upon Israel which does not contain some payment for the sin of the golden calf."]
32:35	And the L rd smote the people with plague [(those who had sinned in the presence of witnesses but who had not been warned — see 20 above)] because they had made the calf that Aaron had made.
33
33:1	And the L rd said to Moses: Go, ascend from here [(Eretz Yisrael is the highest of all lands)], you and the people [("the people," as opposed to "your people" (see 32:7)], whom you brought up from the land of Egypt to the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying: "To your seed shall I give it."
33:2	And I shall send an angel before you. And I shall drive out the Canaani, the Emori, the Chitti, the Perizi, the Chivi, and the Yevussi. [(The Girgashi left of its own accord.)]
33:3	[And you shall bring them up] to a land flowing with milk and honey. [I tell you that I will send an angel before you] for I shall not ascend in your midst. For you are a stiff-necked people, [and when My shechinah is in your midst and you rebel against Me, My wrath is intensified.] (I shall not ascend in your midst, then,) lest I destroy you on the way.
33:4	And the people heard this evil thing [(that the shechinah would not abide with them)] and they mourned, and none of them put on his adornment [(the crowns that were bequeathed them at Chorev when they said (24:7): "We shall do and we shall hear.")]
33:5	And the L rd said to Moses: Say to the children of Israel: You are a stiff-necked people. If I ascended in your midst [and you rebelled against Me in your stiff-neckedness, I would rage against you for] one instant and I would annihilate you. And now, [with this punishment you shall be smitten immediately — that you] remove your adornment from you, and [(as to the balance of your punishment)], I shall know what to do to you.
33:6	And the children of Israel divested themselves of their adornment [which had been bequeathed them] at Mount Chorev.
33:7	And Moses [from that sin onwards] would take the tent (his tent) and pitch it outside the camp [saying: "He who is banished from the Teacher is banished from the student (Moses)"], far from the camp [(two thousand cubits)], and he would call it "the tent of meeting" [for seekers of Torah.] And all who sought the L rd [(whence it is derived that "soliciting an elder is like paying attendance upon the shechinah")] would go out to the tent of meeting that was outside the camp.
33:8	And it was, when Moses went out [to go] to the tent, that all the people would rise, and each one would stand at the door of his tent and look after Moses [out of respect, and not sit down] until he had come to the tent.
33:9	And it was, when Moses came to the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the door of the tent, and He would speak, with Moses [hearing].
33:10	And all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the door of the tent, and all the people would rise and bow down [to the shechinah], each one at the door of his tent.
33:11	And the L rd would speak, with Moses [hearing], face to face, as a man speaks with his fellow. And [after the L rd's speaking], he would return to the camp [and teach the elders what he had learned. (Moses followed this practice from Yom Kippur until the mishkan was erected.)] And his attendant, Joshua the son of Nun, a youth, would not depart from within the tent.
33:12	And Moses said to the L rd: See, You say to me: "Bring up this people," and You did not apprise me whom You would send with me. [Your sending an angel is not acceptable to me.] And You said [see 19:9]: "I have known you by name" [i.e., I have singled you out from others], "and you have also found favor in My eyes."
33:13	And now, if I have, indeed, found favor in Your eyes, make known to me Your ways [i.e., the reward for finding favor in Your eyes], so that I know You [i.e., Your measure of reward], so that I find [what the nature of the reward is for finding] favor in Your eyes. And see that this nation is Your people, [and I cannot see myself being rewarded if they are not].
33:14	And He said: My face [i.e., I Myself] shall go [and not an angel], and I shall give you rest.
33:15	And he said to Him: [This, indeed, is what I desire, for] if You Yourself do not go, [but an angel], do not bring us up from here.
33:16	For how, otherwise, will it be known that I and Your people have found favor in Your eyes? Is it not by Your going with us? And [I have yet another request: that You not repose Your shechinah on the nations of the world so that] I and Your people be distinct from all the people on the face of the earth.
33:17	And the L rd said to Moses: This thing, too, that you have spoken [(to repose My shechinah no more on the nations of the world)] will I do. For you have found favor in My eyes and I have known you by name.
33:18	And [sensing it to be an opportune moment] he said: Show me, I pray you, Your glory.
33:19	And He said: I shall cause all of My goodness to pass before you [when you are concealed in the cave], and I shall call in the name of the L rd before you [to teach you the order of imploring mercy even when the merit of the fathers (zcuth avoth) no longer obtains. And you teach Israel to pray according to that order ("the Thirteen Attributes") and their prayers for mercy will thereby be granted]; and I shall be gracious when I desire to be so, and I shall be merciful when I desire to be so, [(but later (34:10) He assured Moses that "the Thirteen Attributes" are never unavailing)].
33:20	And He said: You shall not be permitted to see My face [even when I pass all My good before you]; for no man can see Me and live.
33:21	And the L rd said: Behold, [in the mountain where I am wont to speak with you], there is a place with Me [i.e., set aside for Me for your needs (so that you not be harmed), where you will see what you shall see], and you will stand on the rock.
33:22	And it shall be, when My glory passes by, that I shall place you in the cleft of the rock, and I shall cover you with My "palm" until I have passed.
33:23	Then I shall remove My palm, and you shall see My back [(He showed him the head-knot of His tefillin)], but My face shall not be seen.
34
34:1	And the L rd said to Moses: Hew (p'sal) for yourself two stone tablets like the first [(He showed him a sapphire quarry and said to him: "The chips (psoleth) shall be yours" (thus, "for yourself." Moses grew wealthy from them.)] [Moses broke the first tablets; he was, therefore, told to hew the second.] And I shall write on the tablets the words which were on the first tablets, which you broke.
34:2	And be ready in the morning, and go up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and stand for Me there on the top of the mountain.
34:3	And let no man go up with you, and also let no man be seen on all of the mountain. The flocks and the herds, too, shall not graze opposite that mountain. [Because the first tablets were given amidst shouting, sound, and throng, the evil eye prevailed against them (and they were broken). There is nothing more desirable than "modesty."]
34:4	And he hewed two stone tablets like the first, and Moses arose early in the morning, and he went up to Mount Sinai as the L rd had commanded him, and he took in his hand two stone tablets.
34:5	And the L rd descended in a cloud and He stood with him there, and He called in the name of the L rd [(see 33:19)]:
34:6	And the L rd passed before him and He called "Hashem (Yod-Keh-Vav-Keh), Hashem, [the attribute of mercy: one (Hashem) before the sin; one, after sinning and repentance], the G d [(Kel, likewise the attribute of mercy)], who is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, [withholding His anger in anticipation of repentance], and abundant in lovingkindness [to those who are in need of it, being deficient in merit], and truth, [paying goodly reward to the doers of His will],
34:7	Preserving [a man's] lovingkindness [before Him] for two thousand [generations], forgiving [deliberate] sin, and [acts of] rebellion (against the L rd), and transgression — but not absolving [completely]. He remembers the sin of the fathers upon sons [who persist in their fathers' ways], and upon sons of sons, upon the third [generation] and upon the fourth."
34:8	And Moses hastened [when he saw the shechinah passing by and heard the "calling"], and he bowed to the ground and prostrated himself.
34:9	And he said: If I have now found favor in Your eyes, my L rd, let my L rd go in our midst [as You have promised (33:14) and even] if it is a stiff-necked people [and it rebels against You, (concerning which You have said (Ibid. 33:3): "Lest I destroy you on the way")], You will (nevertheless) forgive our sin and our transgression, and You will make us Your [distinct] portion [viz. (Ibid.16)].
34:10	And He said: Behold, I am making a covenant [for this]. Before all your people shall I make (wondrous) distinctions [(whereby you will be distinguished from all other nations, on whom My shechinah will not repose)], which (wonders) have never been created in all the land and in all the nations. And all the people in whose midst you are will see the work of the L rd. For it is awesome, what I am to do with you.
34:11	Be heedful of what I command you this day. Behold, I am driving out before you the Emori, the Canaani, the Chitti, the Perizi, the Chivi, and the Yevussi [(The Girgashi left of its own accord.)]
34:12	Be heedful lest you make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land to which you are coming, lest it be a snare in your midst.
34:13	But their altars shall you raze, and their monuments shall you break, and their trees devoted to idolatry shall you cut down.
34:14	For you shall not bow down to another god. For the L rd, Kana ("zealous") is His name, [zealous in exacting payment and not overlooking things]; He is a zealous G d.
34:15	Lest you make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land and they stray after their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and he call to you and you eat from his sacrifice. [I shall regard your eating from his sacrifice as acknowledging his idolatry, for, as a result, "You will take of his daughters for your sons, etc."]
34:16	And you will take of his daughters for your sons, and his daughters will stray after their gods, and they will cause your sons to stray after their gods.
34:17	Molten gods you shall not make for yourself.
34:18	The festival of matzoth shall you keep. Seven days shall you eat matzoth as I commanded you, in the appointed time in the month of aviv [the first ripening]. For in the month of aviv you went out of Egypt.
34:19	All firstlings of the womb [in man] are Mine, and (of) all of your kine that bears a male, the firstling of an ox or a sheep.
34:20	And the firstling of an ass [(but not another unclean beast)] you shall redeem with a lamb [(He gives the lamb to the Cohein. It is chullin (non-sacred) in the hand of the Cohein, and the owner may work with the firstling)]. And if you do not redeem it, then you shall break its neck [with a hatchet. (He caused a monetary loss to the Cohein — let him incur such a loss!)]. All the first-born of your sons shall you redeem; and they [the children of Israel, when they go up to Jerusalem for the festival,] shall not appear before Me empty-handed, [but they shall bring the prescribed offering].
34:21	Six days shall you work, and on the seventh day shall you rest. From [mundane] plowing and harvesting shall you rest [(to exclude harvesting the omer which is a mitzvah, and which overrides the Sabbath)].
34:22	And the festival of Shavuoth shall you make for yourself, the first-fruits of the wheat harvest, [the "two breads" (see Leviticus 23:16-17), the first wheat meal-offering brought to the Temple, (the meal-offering of the omer brought on Pesach, being of barley)], and the festival of the ingathering (Succoth), [when you gather your produce from the field to the house], the circuit of the year [i.e., the beginning of the new year].
34:23	Three times in the year shall all of your males appear before the L rd, Hashem (Yod-Keh-Vav-Keh), the G d of Israel.
34:24	For I shall drive out nations from before you, and I shall broaden your boundary, [so that, being far from the Temple, you will not be able to appear before Me constantly, for which reason I am providing these three festivals for you (to do so)]. And no man shall covet your land when you go up to appear before the L rd your G d three times in the year.
34:25	You shall not slaughter while chametz [still] is present, the blood of My [Pesach] offering [(an exhortation (against possessing chametz) to the slaughterer, the tosser of the blood, and any of the members of the "company" (for that offering)]. And there shall not tarry overnight [off the altar] until morning, the slaughtering [i.e., the eimurin (the consecrated parts)] of the festival of Pesach. [The same applies to all offerings.]
34:26	The first of the first-fruits of your land [i.e., of the seven species mentioned in praise of your land (Deuteronomy 8:8)] you shall bring to the house of the L rd your G d. You shall not cook a kid in its mother's milk. [(This excludes (from Torah interdiction) fowl, where there is no "mother's milk")]. [See 23:19].
34:27	And the L rd said to Moses: Write for yourself these words [(but you are not permitted to write oral Torah)]; for according to these words have I made with you a covenant and with Israel.
34:28	And he was there with the L rd forty days and forty nights. Bread he did not eat and water he did not drink. And He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
34:29	And it was, when Moses descended [(with the second tablets, on Yom Kippur)] from Mount Sinai — with the two tablets of the testimony in the hand of Moses, when he descended from the mountain — that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone [(the light projecting like horns)] from His having spoken with him.
34:30	And Aaron and all of Israel saw Moses, and, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to approach him.
34:31	And Moses called to them, and there returned to him Aaron and all the princes of the assembly, and Moses would speak to them [the behest of the L rd].
34:32	And after that [i.e., after he had taught the elders], all the children of Israel would approach, and he would command them all that the L rd had spoken with him on Mount Sinai.
34:33	And when Moses finished speaking with them, he would place a mask on his face, [in deference to the rays of splendor, that not all "feast their eyes on them."]
34:34	And when Moses came before the L rd to speak with Him, he would put off the mask until he went forth; and he would go forth and speak to the children of Israel what he had been commanded.
34:35	And the children of Israel beheld Moses' face, for the skin of Moses' face shone. And [when he took leave of them], Moses would put the mask back on his face until he came to speak with Him, [when he would doff it].

35:1	And Moses assembled [on the day after Yom Kippur, when he had descended from the mountain] the entire congregation of the children of Israel, and he said to them: These are the things that the L rd commanded to do.
35:2	Six days may work be done, and on the seventh day it shall be holy for you, a Sabbath of resting for the L rd. Whoever does work on it shall be put to death. [Moses states the exhortation against working on the Sabbath before charging them with the work of the mishkan by way of apprising them that it does not override the Sabbath.]
35:3	You shall not light a fire in all of your dwellings on the Sabbath day.
35:4	And Moses said to the entire congregation of the children of Israel, saying: This is the thing that the L rd commanded [me] to say [to you].
35:5	Take from yourselves an offering for the L rd. Everyone whose heart prompts him shall bring it, the offering of the L rd: gold, silver, and copper.
35:6	And blue wool, and purple wool, and scarlet wool, and linen, and goats' hair.
35:7	And rams' skins dyed red, and tachash skins, and acacia wood.
35:8	And oil for the lighting, and spices for the anointing oil and for the burning of the incense.
35:9	And shoham stones and filling stones for the ephod and for the choshen.
35:10	And all the wise of heart among you shall come and make all that the L rd has commanded:
35:11	The mishkan [(The bottom spreads, seen from the inside, are called "mishkan")], its tent [(the tent of goats' hair curtains serving as a roof)], and its covering [(the covering of ram and tachash hides)], its hooks, its beams, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets.
35:12	The ark and its staves, the kaporeth and the parocheth partition.
35:13	The table and its staves and all of its vessels, and the show-bread.
35:14	And the menorah of lighting and its implements [tongs and snuff-dishes], and its lamps [cups into which the oil and wicks were put], and the oil for lighting. [This, too, required "wise of heart," its processing being different from that of other oils.]
35:15	And the incense altar and its staves, and the anointing oil, and the incense spices, and the entrance screen [on the east (26:36)] for the entrance of the mishkan.
35:16	The burnt-offering altar and its copper lattice, its staves and all its implements, the kiyyor and its pedestal.
35:17	The curtains of the court, its pillars and its sockets, and the screen of the gate of the court [on the east (27:16)].
35:18	The pegs of the mishkan [(for securing the curtain ends in the ground so that they not flap in the wind)], and the pegs of the court, and their cords.
35:19	The mesh vestments for covering the holy [appurtenances (the ark, the table, the menorah, and the altars)], the consecrated garments of Aaron the Cohein, and the garments of his sons for ministering.
35:20	And the entire assembly of the children of Israel went forth from Moses' presence.
35:21	And there came every man whose heart moved him. And everyone whose spirit prompted him brought the offering of the L rd for the work of the tent of meeting and for all of its labor and for the consecrated vestments.
35:22	And the men came along with the women. All whose heart prompted them brought armband and nose-ring and finger-ring and chumaz [a pudendal ornament] — all ornaments of gold — and every man who brought an offering of gold to the L rd.
35:23	And every man with whom was found blue wool or purple wool or scarlet wool or linen or goats' hair or rams' hides dyed red or tachash hides brought it.
35:24	All who set aside an offering of silver or copper brought the offering of the L rd. And all with whom was found acacia wood for any part of the work brought it.
35:25	And every woman wise of heart spun with her hands. And they brought spun, the blue wool, the purple wool, the scarlet wool, and the linen.
35:26	And all the women whose hearts lifted them with wisdom spun the goats' hair [directly from their backs].
35:27	And the princes (of the tribes) brought [(after nothing else remained to be brought)] the shoham stones and the filling stones for the ephod and for the choshen.
35:28	And the spice and the oil for lighting and for the oil of anointment and for the incense spices.
35:29	Every man and woman whose heart prompted them to bring for all of the work that the L rd had commanded to do by the hand of Moses — the children of Israel brought an offering to the L rd.
35:30	And Moses said to the children of Israel: See, the L rd has called by name Betzalel the son of Uri the son of Chur [Miriam's son] of the tribe of Judah.
35:31	And He filled him with the spirit of G d, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge, and with (skill in) all work.
35:32	And to devise designs, to work in gold, silver, and copper.
35:33	And in stone work, to fill [the stone into its setting], and in wood work to do all kinds of artistic work.
35:34	And to teach, He put it in his heart, he and Ahaliav the son of Achisamach of the tribe of Dan.
35:35	He filled them with wisdom of heart to do every work of craftsman, artist, and embroiderer, in blue wool, purple wool, scarlet wool, and linen; and weaver, doing all work and making designs.
36
36:1	And Betzalel and Ahaliav and every man wise of heart in whom the L rd has put wisdom and understanding to know to do all the work for the labor of the sanctuary shall do all that the L rd has commanded.
36:2	And Moses called to Betzalel and to Ahaliav and to every man wise of heart, in whose heart the L rd had put wisdom, every one whose heart had lifted him to draw near to the work to do it.
36:3	And they took from before Moses the entire offering that the children of Israel had brought for the work of the labor of the sanctuary, to do it. And they brought him yet more offerings every morning.
36:4	And there came all the wise men, the doers of all the work of the sanctuary, each from his work that they were doing.
36:5	And they said to Moses: The people are bringing more than is needed for the work that the L rd commanded to do.
36:6	And Moses commanded, and they announced in the camp, saying: Let man and woman not do any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. And the people were held back from bringing.
36:7	And the work [of the bringing] was sufficient [for the builders of the mishkan] for all of the work [of the mishkan], to make it and to leave (something) over.
36:8	And all the wise of heart among the doers of the work made the mishkan of ten curtains. Twisted linen, blue wool, purple wool, scarlet wool; cherubs, of artistic work he made them.
36:9	The length of one curtain, twenty-eight cubits; and the width, four cubits for one curtain — one measure for all the curtains.
36:10	And he attached five curtains one to the other, and five curtains one to the other.
36:11	And he made loops of purple wool at the edge of one curtain at its edge in the joining. So did he do at the edge of the end curtain of the other joining.
36:12	Fifty loops he made in the one (end) curtain, and fifty loops he made at the edge of the (end) curtain in the second joining, the loops [on the respective joinings] directly aligned one with the other.
36:13	And he made fifty golden hooks, and he joined the curtains one to the other by the hooks, and the mishkan was one.
36:14	And he made curtains of goats' hair to tent over the [lower curtains of the] mishkan. Eleven curtains he made them.
36:15	The length of one curtain, thirty cubits; and four cubits the width for one curtain — one measure for the eleven curtains.
36:16	And he joined the five curtains separately and the six curtains separately.
36:17	And he made fifty loops at the edge of the end curtain in one joining; and fifty loops he made at the edge of the (end) curtain in the second joining.
36:18	And he made fifty copper hooks to join the tent [the goats' hair covering] to be one.
36:19	And he made a cover for the tent, rams' skins dyed red, and a cover of tachash skins above.
36:20	And he made the beams for the mishkan, standing acacia wood.
36:21	Ten cubits the length of the beam, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each beam.
36:22	Two prongs for each beam, rung-like, one near the other. So did he do for all the beams of the mishkan.
36:23	And he made the beams for the mishkan, twenty beams for the southern side.
36:24	And forty silver sockets he made under the twenty beams; two sockets under one beam for its two prongs, and two sockets under the next beam for its two prongs.
36:25	And for the second side of the mishkan, the northern side, he made twenty beams.
36:26	And their forty silver sockets, two sockets under one beam and two sockets under the next beam.
36:27	And for the ends [i.e., the back] of the mishkan on the west, he made six beams.
36:28	And two beams he made for the corners of the mishkan at the ends.
36:29	And they were fitted against each other at the bottom, and together they were fitted at the top by the one ring. So did he do for the two of them, for the two corners.
36:30	And [on the western side] there were eight beams and their silver sockets, sixteen sockets, two sockets under each beam.
36:31	And he made bars of acacia wood, five for the beams of one side of the mishkan.
36:32	And five bars for the beams of the second side of the mishkan, and five bars for the beams of the mishkan at the western ends.
36:33	And he made the middle bar to extend in the midst of the beams from end to end.
36:34	And the beams he covered with gold, and their rings he made of gold [to serve as] housings for the bars; and he covered the bars with gold.
36:35	And he made the parocheth of blue wool and purple wool and scarlet wool and twisted linen. Artistic work he made it, cherubs.
36:36	And he made for it four pillars of acacia wood and he covered them with gold, their hooks of gold. And he cast for them four silver sockets.
36:37	And he made a screen for the entrance of the tent, of blue wool, purple wool, scarlet wool, and twisted linen, the work of an embroiderer.
36:38	And its pillars five, and their hooks, and he covered their tops and their belts with gold; and their sockets five, of copper.
37
37:1	And Betzalel made the ark [(its making being ascribed to him rather than to the other artisans because of his total dedication to the work)], of acacia wood: two and a half cubits, its length; one and a half cubits, its breadth; and one and a half cubits, its height.
37:2	And he covered it with pure gold from inside and from outside. And he made for it a rim of gold roundabout.
37:3	And he cast for it four golden rings for its four corners; two rings on one side and two rings on the other side.
37:4	And he made staves of acacia wood and he covered them with gold.
37:5	And he inserted the staves in the rings on the sides of the ark to carry the ark therewith.
37:6	And he made a kaporeth of pure gold: two and a half cubits its length and a cubit and a half its width.
37:7	And he made two golden cherubs. Of beaten work he made them, at the two ends of the kaporeth.
37:8	One cherub at one end and one cherub at the other end. From the kaporeth [itself] he made the cherubs, from its two ends.
37:9	And the cherubs had their wings spread on high, covering the kaporeth with their wings from above. And their faces were towards each other. Towards the kaporeth were the faces of the cherubs.
37:10	And he made the table of acacia wood: two cubits, its length; one cubit, its breadth; and a cubit and a half, its height.
37:11	And he covered it with pure gold, and he made for it a rim of gold roundabout.
37:12	And he made a frame for it, a handbreadth roundabout. And he made a golden rim for its frame roundabout.
37:13	And he cast for it four golden rings. And he placed the rings on the four corners of its four legs.
37:14	Opposite the [corners of the] frame were the rings, housings for the staves for the carrying of the table.
37:15	And he made the staves of acacia wood, and he covered them with gold, to carry the table therewith.
37:16	And he made the implements which were on the table: its [bread-] moulds, its censers, its canes, and its staves, by which [canes] it [the show-bread] was covered — pure gold.
37:17	And he made the menorah of pure gold. Of beaten work did he make the menorah. Its base, its [central] shaft, its bowls, its bulbs, and its flowers were (fashioned) from it [the one piece of gold].
37:18	And six branches emerged from its sides, three branches of the menorah from one side, and three branches of the menorah from the other side.
37:19	Three chased bowls on one branch, with bulb and flower; and three chased bowls on the other branch, with bulb and flower. So, with (all) six branches that project from the menorah.
37:20	And on the [central shaft of the] menorah were four bowls, chased, its bulbs and its flowers.
37:21	And a bulb under the two branches from it [the one piece of gold], and a bulb under the (next) two branches from it, and a bulb under the next two branches from it, (thus) for (all) the six branches that project from it.
37:22	Their bulbs and their branches from it were (fashioned), all one (piece of) beaten work of pure gold.
37:23	And he made its lamps, seven, and its tongs and its snuff-dishes, pure gold.
37:24	(Of) a talent of pure gold he made it [together] with all of its vessels.
37:25	And he made the incense altar of acacia wood, a cubit its length and a cubit its width — square — and two cubits its height. From it were its horns (made).
37:26	And he covered it with pure gold, its roof and its walls roundabout and its horns. And he made for it a rim of gold roundabout.
37:27	And he made for it two golden rings, beneath its rim at its two corners, on its two sides, for housings for the staves to carry it thereby.
37:28	And he made the staves of acacia wood and he covered them with gold.
37:29	And he made the oil of sacred anointment and the pure incense spices, the work of a spice blender.
38
38:1	And he made the burnt-offering altar of acacia wood, five cubits its length and five cubits its width — square — and three cubits its height.
38:2	And he made its horns on its four corners. From it [the altar itself] were its horns (made). And he covered it with copper.
38:3	And he made all the implements of the altar: the pots, and the shovels, and the sprinkling basins, and the spits, and the fire-pans. All of its implements he made of copper.
38:4	And he made for the altar a copper lattice, netting work, under its karkov [an encircling decorative band] below, (and the netting extended) until its (the altar's) mid-point.
38:5	And he cast four rings on the four edges of the copper lattice, housings for the staves.
38:6	And he made the staves of acacia wood, and he covered them with copper.
38:7	And he inserted the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar to carry it therewith. A hollow of boards did he make it [the altar].
38:8	And he made the kiyyor (the laver) of copper and its pedestal of copper with [the copper of] the mirrors of the congregating women, who congregated [to bring their contributions] at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
38:9	And he made the court (of the mishkan), on the southern side, the curtains of the court of twisted linen, a hundred cubits (long on one side).
38:10	Their pillars twenty and their sockets twenty, of copper; the hooks of the pillars and their belts, of silver.
38:11	And on the northern side, a hundred cubits, their pillars twenty and their sockets twenty, of copper; the hooks of the pillars and their belts, of silver.
38:12	And on the western side, curtains, fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets, ten; the hooks of the pillars and their belts, of silver.
38:13	And on the front side, to the east, fifty cubits.
38:14	Curtains, fifteen cubits, on the shoulder, their pillars three and their sockets three.
38:15	And on the second shoulder, (one) on either side of the gate of the court, curtains, fifteen cubits, their pillars three and their sockets three.
38:16	All the curtains of the court roundabout, of twisted linen.
38:17	And the sockets for the pillars, of copper, the hooks of the pillars and their belts, of silver, and the covering of their tops, of silver. And they were belted with silver, all the pillars of the court.
38:18	And the screen of the gate of the court, the work of an embroiderer, blue wool, and purple wool, and scarlet wool, and twisted linen; and (it was) twenty cubits long, and high in (its) width five cubits, as the size [five cubits] of the curtains of the court.
38:19	And their pillars four and their sockets four, of copper; their hooks, of silver, and the covering of their tops and their belt, of silver.
38:20	And all the pegs of the mishkan and of the court roundabout, of copper.
Pekudei
38:21	These are the accountings of the [donations for and the appurtenances of] the mishkan, the mishkan of testimony [testimony to G d's having "bypassed" the sin of the golden calf, having reposed His shechinah there. (The doubling of "mishkan" alludes to the Temple's twice having been taken as "collateral" (mashkon) for the sins of Israel)], (the accountings made) by word of Moses [of the articles of] the service of the Levites, [the Levites carrying them, setting them up, and taking them down] as designated by Ithamar the son of Aaron the Cohein, [Ithamar assigning to each Levitical "father's house" its specific service.]
38:22	And Betzalel the son of Uri the son of Chur of the tribe of Judah did all that the L rd had commanded Moses, [even things which Moses had not "relayed" to Betzalel. Moses first charged Betzalel to make the appurtenances and then the mishkan, and Betzalel, in practice, reversed the order, this, ("making the house first and then the furnishing"), indeed, according with what the L rd had commanded Moses.]
38:23	And with him, Ahaliav the son of Achisamach of the tribe of Dan, craftsman, artist, and embroiderer, in blue wool, purple wool, scarlet wool, and linen.
38:24	All the gold that was used for the work, in all the work of the sanctuary — the gold of the offering was twenty-nine kikar [(one kikar = three thousand shekels)] and seven hundred and thirty shekels in the shekel of the sanctuary.
38:25	And the silver of the accountings of the assembly: a hundred kikar [(accounting for six hundred thousand people, each giving a half shekel)], and one thousand and seven hundred and seventy-five shekels in the shekel of the sanctuary.
38:26	A beka [a half shekel] for every head, a half shekel in the shekel of the sanctuary for all who passed to be counted, from the age of twenty years and above, for six hundred and three thousand and five hundred and fifty (men).
38:27	And the hundred kikar of silver were for casting the sockets of the [beams of the] sanctuary [the mishkan (ninety-six sockets for forty-eight beams)] and the sockets of the parocheth [(four sockets for four pillars)]. A hundred sockets for a hundred kikar, a kikar per socket.
38:28	And from the one thousand and seven hundred and seventy-five, he made hooks for the pillars and covered their [the pillars'] tops and belted them.
38:29	And the copper of the offering was seventy kikar and two thousand and four hundred shekels.
38:30	And he made of it the sockets of the entrance of the tent of meeting, and the copper altar, and its copper lattice, and all the implements of the altar.
38:31	And the sockets of the court roundabout, and the sockets of the gate of the court, and all the pegs of the mishkan, and all the pegs of the court roundabout.
39
39:1	And from the purple wool and the blue wool they made mesh vestments for covering the holy (appurtenances) [see 35:19] and they made the consecrated garments of Aaron, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
39:2	And he made the ephod of gold, blue wool, purple wool, scarlet wool, and twisted linen.
39:3	And they beat the plates of gold and cut [from the thin plate] strands to work into the blue wool [(i.e., one thread of gold intertwined with six of blue wool, etc.)]. And into the purple wool, and into the scarlet wool, and into the linen, the work of an artist.
39:4	Shoulder straps did they make for it, attached — attached at its two ends.
39:5	And the cheishev [the belt] of his adornment which is above it, was of it, after its manner [see 28:8], gold, blue wool, purple wool, scarlet wool, and twisted linen, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
39:6	And they made the shoham stones surrounded by golden settings, engraved as the engraving of a signet with the names of the children of Israel.
39:7	And he placed them on the shoulder straps of the ephod, stones of remembrance for the children of Israel, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
39:8	And he made the choshen, artistic work, like the work of the ephod: gold, blue wool, purple wool, scarlet wool, and twisted linen.
39:9	It was square; folded did they make the choshen, a zereth its length and a zereth its width, folded.
39:10	And they filled it with four rows of stone. A row of odem, pitedah and bareketh, the one row.
39:11	The second row — nofech, sapir, and yahalom.
39:12	The third row — leshem, shevo, and achlamah.
39:13	And the fourth row — tarshish, shoham, and yashfeh. They were surrounded by golden settings with their fillings [see 28:20].
39:14	And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve according to their names, like the engraving of a signet, each by his name for the twelve tribes.
39:15	And they made for the choshen chains at the edge, braidwork of pure gold.
39:16	And they made two golden settings and two golden rings, and they placed the two rings on the two settings of the choshen.
39:17	And they placed the two golden braids on the two rings at the ends of the choshen.
39:18	And the two ends of the two braids they placed on the two settings and they placed them on the shoulder straps of the ephod on its face.
39:19	And they made two golden rings, and they placed them on the two ends of the choshen on its edge which faces the ephod, inwards.
39:20	And they made two golden rings, and they placed them on the (origin of the) two shoulder straps of the ephod below, on its face, opposite [i.e., near] where it is attached, above the cheishev of the ephod.
39:21	And they bound the choshen from its rings to the rings of the ephod with a string of blue wool to be on the cheishev of the ephod. And the choshen shall not be detached from the ephod, as the L rd commanded Moses.
39:22	And he made the me'il of the ephod, the work of a weaver, entirely of blue wool.
39:23	And the head-opening of the me'il was (folded over) within it, as the opening of a suit of armor. Its opening had a border roundabout, so that it not be torn.
39:24	And they made on the (lower) hem of the me'il pomegranates of blue wool, and purple wool, and scarlet wool, twisted.
39:25	And they made bells of pure gold, and they placed the bells in the midst of the pomegranates, on the hem of the me'il roundabout in the midst of the pomegranates.
39:26	A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, on the hem of the me'il roundabout, to minister, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
39:27	And they made the kathnoth of linen, the work of a weaver, for Aaron and his sons.
39:28	And the mitznefeth of linen, and the splendrous migbaoth of linen and the linen michnasayim of twisted linen.
39:29	And the avneit of twisted linen and blue wool, purple wool, and scarlet wool, the work of an embroiderer, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
39:30	And they made the tzitz, the holy crown of pure gold. And they inscribed it as the engraving of a signet: "Holy to the L rd."
39:31	And they placed on it a string of blue wool to place on the mitznefeth from above, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
39:32	And all the work of the mishkan of the tent of meeting was completed. And the children of Israel did [the work]. As all that the L rd had commanded Moses; thus did they do.
39:33	And they brought the mishkan to Moses [to set up (lacking the strength to do it themselves)], the tent and all its implements: its hooks, its beams, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets.
39:34	And the cover of rams' skins dyed red, and the cover of tachash skins, and the parocheth partition.
39:35	The ark of testimony and its staves and the kaporeth.
39:36	The table and all its implements and the show-bread.
39:37	The pure menorah, its lamps — the lamps of the arrangement (27:21) — and all its implements and the oil for lighting.
39:38	And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the spice incense, and the partition for the entrance of the tent.
39:39	The copper altar, its copper lattice, its staves, and all its implements, the kiyyor and its pedestal.
39:40	The curtains of the court, its pillars and its sockets and the partition for the gate of the court, its cords and its pegs, and all the implements of the service of the mishkan of the tent of meeting.
39:41	The mesh vestments for covering the holy (appurtenances), the consecrated garments of Aaron the Cohein, and the garments of his sons for ministering.
39:42	As all that the L rd had commanded Moses, thus did the children of Israel do all of the work.
39:43	And Moses saw all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the L rd had commanded; thus had they done it. And Moses blessed them.
40
40:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
40:2	On the first day of the first month, you shall set up the mishkan of the tent of meeting.
40:3	And you shall place there the ark of testimony, and you shall screen the ark with the parocheth.
40:4	And you shall bring the table and make its arrangement [the two arrangements of the show bread (see Leviticus 24:5-6)], and you shall bring the menorah and you shall light its lamps.
40:5	And you shall place the golden altar for (smoking) incense before the ark of testimony, and you shall place the entrance partition for the mishkan.
40:6	And you shall place the burnt-offering altar before the entrance of the mishkan of the tent of meeting.
40:7	And you shall place the kiyyor between the tent of meeting and the altar and you shall put water there.
40:8	And you shall set up the court roundabout, and you shall place the screen of the gate of the court.
40:9	And you shall take the anointing oil and you shall anoint the mishkan and all that is in it. And you shall consecrate it and all of its appurtenances, and it shall be holy.
40:10	And you shall anoint the burnt-offering altar and all of its implements. And you shall consecrate the altar, and the altar shall be holy of holies.
40:11	And you shall anoint the kiyyor and its pedestal, and you shall consecrate it.
40:12	And you shall bring near Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting and you shall wash them with water.
40:13	And you shall clothe Aaron in the holy garments, and you shall anoint him, and you shall consecrate him, and he shall minister unto Me.
40:14	And his sons shall you bring near, and you shall dress them in kutanoth.
40:15	And you shall anoint them as you anointed their father. And they shall minister unto Me. and this will serve for their anointment to be for them an eternal kehunah for their generations.
40:16	And Moses did as all that the L rd had commanded him; thus did he do.
40:17	And it was in the first month of the second year on the first of the month that the mishkan was set up.
40:18	And Moses erected the mishkan. He placed its sockets and he set its beams, and he placed its bars and he set up its pillars.
40:19	And he spread the tent [the goats' hair spread] on the mishkan. And he placed the covering of the tent above it, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
40:20	And he took and he placed the testimony [the tablets] into the ark. And he put the staves on the ark. And he placed the kaporeth on the ark from above.
40:21	And he brought the ark to the mishkan, and he placed the parocheth partition and it screened the ark of testimony, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
40:22	And he put the table in the tent of meeting on the side of the mishkan north [i.e., on the northern half of the breadth of the sanctuary], outside the parocheth.
40:23	And he arranged on it a bread arrangement before the L rd, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
40:24	And he put the menorah in the tent of meeting opposite the table on the side of the mishkan south.
40:25	And he lit the lamps before the L rd as the L rd had commanded Moses.
40:26	And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before (i.e., inside) the parocheth.
40:27	And he smoked upon it spice incense, as the L rd had commanded Moses [see 30:7-8].
40:28	And he placed the entrance partition for the mishkan.
40:29	And the burnt-offering altar he placed at the entrance of the mishkan of the tent of meeting. And he offered up upon it the burnt-offering [the continual burnt-offering] and the meal-offering [accompanying the libations of the continual burnt-offering (29:40)], as the L rd had commanded Moses.
40:30	And he put the kiyyor between the tent of meeting and the altar, and he put there water for washing.
40:31	And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed from it their hands and their feet, [all of them being equal for kehunah on the eighth day of the investiture of the Cohanim (which was the day of the erection of the mishkan)].
40:32	When they came to the tent of meeting and when they approached the altar they would wash, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
40:33	And he erected the court around the mishkan and the altar, and he placed the screen of the gate of the court. And Moses completed the work.
40:34	And the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the L rd filled the mishkan.
40:35	And Moses could not come to the tent of meeting, for the cloud rested upon it and the glory of the L rd filled the mishkan.
40:36	And when the cloud rose from the mishkan, the children of Israel would travel on all of their journeys.
40:37	And if the cloud did not rise, they did not journey until the day of its rising.
40:38	For the cloud of the L rd was on the mishkan by day, and a fire was in it at night before the eyes of all the house of Israel in all of their journeyings [i.e., in all the encampments of their journeyings].

 
Vayikra
1
1:1	And He called (vayikra) [("kriyah" is an expression of endearment)] to Moses [(G d's voice reached Moses' ears only)], and the L rd spoke (vayedaber) [(There is "calling" only for (initial) "speaking" (dibbur), and not for pauses (subsections within the sections)] to him [and not to Aaron] from the tent of meeting [(the voice "cutting off" and not traveling beyond the tent of meeting)], "saying" [i.e., Speak to them (Israel) with "suasion"]
1:2	Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: A man (adam) [(Just as Adam did not sacrifice what was stolen, so, you)], if he offer from you an offering to the L rd, from the beasts [(but not all — to exclude participants, active or passive, in sodomy)], from the cattle [(to exclude objects of idolatry)] and from the sheep [(to exclude animals designated for idolatry) ("from the beasts" like cattle and sheep, but not undomesticated animals) ("and from the sheep" — to exclude animals which gored men to death)] shall you (plural) offer [(two may offer a burnt-offering in partnership)] your (plural) offering [(It may be a communal gift offering)].
1:3	If his offering is a burnt-offering, from the cattle [("from") — to exclude a treifah (a "torn," ritually unfit, animal)], a male, [and not a female], without blemish, shall he offer it; to the door of the tent of meeting shall he bring it [(He must attend to getting it to the azarah (the Temple court)], of his own volition, before the L rd [(There is no semichah (4) at a bamah (a temporary altar)].
1:4	And he shall place (vesamach) his hand on the head of the [(excluding (from semichah) the burnt-offering of fowl)] burnt-offering [(including an obligatory burnt-offering and the burnt-offering of sheep)], and it shall be acceptable for him to make atonement for him [for transgressions of positive commandments or for negative commandments linked to positive commandments].
1:5	And he shall slaughter [(It is permissible for a non-priest to slaughter)] the bullock before the L rd [in the azarah], and the sons of Aaron, the priests [(they must be fit for the priesthood)] shall present [i.e., receive and bring] the blood, and they shall dash the blood [(including blood which intermingled with that of an offering of its kind or of another kind)] on the altar roundabout [(two "dashings" (from a vessel) on two (diagonally) opposite corners of the altar)], which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting [(but not when the tent of meeting is dismantled)].
1:6	And he shall flay the burnt-offering [(all burnt-offerings are included)], and he shall cut it into its pieces [(but not its pieces into pieces)].
1:7	And the sons of Aaron the priest [(in his "priesthood," If he officiated in the garments of an ordinary priest, his service is invalid)] shall put fire upon the altar [(Even though fire descends from heaven, it is a mitzvah to bring man-made fire)], and they shall arrange wood upon the fire.
1:8	And the sons of Aaron, the priests [(in their "priesthood." If they officiate in the eight garments of the high-priest, their service is invalid)] shall arrange the pieces, the head [(which was cut off and not flayed)] and the suet [(which is brought up with the head to cover the shechitah site (a deferential act)] upon the wood upon the fire, which is upon the altar [(Pieces of wood should not stick out beyond the wood pile)].
1:9	And its innards and its legs shall he wash with water, and the Cohein shall smoke the whole upon the altar, [specifically] as a burnt-offering, a fire-offering [(He must slaughter it to that end)], a sweet savor, ["gratifying," (in that His will was done)], to the L rd.
1:10	And, [(Whatever applies to "cattle" (3) applies to "flock" and vice versa)] if from the flock is his offering, of the sheep or of the goats, [(excluding the old, sick, or malodorous)], as a burnt-offering, a male [(and not one whose sex is in doubt or a hermaphrodite), without blemish shall he offer it.
1:11	And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar northward before the L rd [(There is no "northward" (requirement) at a bamah (a temporary altar)], and the sons of Aaron, the Cohanim, shall dash its blood on the altar roundabout.
1:12	And he shall cut it into its pieces, and its head, and its suet; and the Cohein shall arrange them upon the wood upon the fire, which is upon the altar.
1:13	And the innards and the legs he shall wash with water, and the Cohein shall offer the whole, and he shall smoke it upon the altar. It is a burnt-offering, a fire-offering, a sweet savor to the L rd.
1:14	And if from the fowl [(excluding a bird that is missing a limb)], a burnt-offering, is his offering to the L rd, then shall he offer his offering from the turtle-doves [(grown ones and not small ones)] or from the young pigeons [(small ones and not grown ones)] [("from the turtle-doves or from the young pigeons") — excluding those whose plumage has just begun brightening].
1:15	And the Cohein shall bring it [(even a single pigeon)] near to the altar, and he shall pinch off its head [(He cuts with his nail against the nape until he reaches the shechitah signs — gullet and windpipe — which he severs)], and he shall smoke it upon the altar; and its blood shall be wrung out [before smoking] against the wall of the altar [(He presses the shechitah site against it and the blood drains down)].
1:16	And he shall remove its crop with its entrails, and he shall cast it beside the altar on the east [of the ramp], in the place of the ashes [removed from the altar and from the menorah].
1:17	And he shall rend it with its feathers [(He need not pluck them out)]; he shall not divide it [completely (but he tears it along its back)]. And the Cohein shall smoke it on the altar, on the wood which is on the fire. It is a burnt-offering, a fire-offering, a sweet savor to the L rd.
2
2:1	And if a soul offer [(The Holy One Blessed be He says: "I shall account it to him as if he had offered his soul")] a meal-offering to the L rd [and he does not specify which, of the five kinds of meal-offering], fine [wheat] flour (soleth) shall be his offering [(this one alone being called "soleth," because it is the only one of the five of which the fistful is taken before baking)]. And he [(even a non-priest)] shall pour oil upon it [(upon all of it)] and he shall put frankincense upon it [(upon part of it)].
2:2	And he shall bring it to the sons of Aaron, the Cohanim, and he (the Cohein) shall take from there [(from wherever the donor is standing in the azarah)] his full fistful, [covering three fingers over the palm of his hand. (From the fistful on is the mitzvah of the kehunah)], of its fine flour and its oil, aside from all of its frankincense [i.e., the frankincense is not included in the fistful]. And the Cohein shall smoke [(the frankincense, too, is smoked)] its "remembrance" [(the fistful, the remembrance of the meal-offering, whereby its owner is remembered for good)] upon the altar, a fire-offering, a sweet savor to the L rd.
2:3	And what is left from the meal-offering shall be for Aaron [(i.e., for the high-priest) without apportionment] and for his sons [with apportionment]. It is holy of holies [to them] of the fire-offerings of the L rd. [They have no portion in it until the fistful has been smoked.]
2:4	And if you bring an offer of a meal-offering baked in an oven, [i.e., If one says: "I vow a meal-offering baked in an oven"], (it shall be) of fine flour: [ten] unleavened cakes mixed with oil, or [ten] unleavened wafers spread with oil. [It may be "second" or "third" oil (and does not require the first oil that comes out of the olive as the menorah does.)]
2:5	And if a meal-offering (baked) on a griddle is your offering, of fine flour mixed with oil [(while it is yet flour)], unleavened bread shall it be.
2:6	You shall break it [(i.e., all meal-offerings that are baked before the fistful is taken)] into pieces [before kemitzah (the taking of the fistful)], and you shall pour oil upon it [(but not upon a meal-offering baked in an oven)]; it is a meal-offering.
2:7	And if a meal-offering of the stewing pan is your offering, of fine flour in oil shall it be made.
2:8	And you shall bring the meal-offering that shall be made of [one of] these kinds to the L rd; and he [the donor] shall present it to the Cohein, and he shall touch it to the [south-west corner of the] altar.
2:9	And the Cohein shall lift from the meal-offering its remembrance [the fistful], and he shall smoke it upon the altar, a fire-offering, a sweet savor to the L rd.
2:10	And what is left from the meal-offering shall be for Aaron and his sons, holy of holies of the fire-offerings of the L rd.
2:11	All of the meal-offering that you offer up to the L rd shall not be made with leaven; for all leaven and all "honey" [any sweet-fruit extract] you shall not smoke from it a fire-offering to the L rd.
2:12	As a first-offering [the two loaves of Atzereth (Shavuoth), which are of leaven, and the bikkurim, of fruit-honey (e.g., figs and dates)] you may offer them up to the L rd; but they shall not come up to the altar for a sweet savor.
2:13	And every offering of your meal-offering you shall salt with salt. And you shall not cut off the salt of the covenant of your G d from your meal-offering. [G d made a covenant for salt from the six days of creation, when the lower waters were "promised" that salt would be offered up on the altar and that water would be offered as a libation (on Succoth).] With all of your offerings [(With the burnt-offering of beast and bird and with the devoted portions (emurim) of all sacrifices)] shall you offer salt.
2:14	And when you offer a meal-offering of first-fruits to the L rd [the meal-offering of the omer], ripened grain [barley] in the ear parched with fire [to stiffen it for milling], groats of the fresh ear [i.e., ground while it is moist] shall you bring the meal-offering of your first-fruits.
2:15	And you shall put oil upon it, and you shall put frankincense upon it; it is a meal-offering.
2:16	And the Cohein shall smoke its remembrance of its groats and of its oil, with all its frankincense, a fire-offering to the L rd.
3
3:1	And if a sacrifice of peace-offerings (shelamim) [(so called because they make peace (shalom) in the world)] is his offering — if he offers it from the herd — whether male or female — without blemish shall he offer it before the L rd.
3:2	And he shall place his hand upon the head of his offering, and he shall slaughter it at the door of the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aaron, the Cohanim, shall dash the blood on the altar roundabout.
3:3	And he shall present from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings a fire-offering to the L rd: the fat that covers the innards and all the fat that is on the innards [According to R. Yishmael, to include the fat on the stomach; according to R. Akiva, to include the fat on the small intestines].
3:4	And the two kidneys and the fat which is upon them, which is on the loins; and the lobe with [some of] the liver, aside from the kidneys, he shall remove it.
3:5	And the sons of Aaron shall smoke it on the altar, aside from the burnt-offering [(the continual burnt-offering preceding every other sacrifice on the wood pile)], which is upon the wood, which is upon the fire, a fire-offering, a sweet savor to the L rd.
3:6	And if his offering is from the flock, for a sacrifice of peace-offerings to the L rd, male or female, without blemish shall he offer it.
3:7	If a lamb he offers for his offering, he shall offer it before the L rd.
3:8	And he shall place his hand upon the head of his offering, and he shall slaughter it before the tent of meeting, and Aaron's sons shall dash its blood on the altar roundabout [see 1:5].
3:9	And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings a fire-offering to the L rd, its [choicest] fat — the fat-tail entire; above the kidneys, he shall remove it, and the fat that covers the innards and all the fat that is on the innards.
3:10	And the two kidneys and the fat which is upon them, which is on the loins; and the lobe with [some of] the liver, aside from the kidneys, he shall remove it.
3:11	And the Cohein shall smoke it upon the altar, the food of a fire-offering to the L rd.
3:12	And if a goat is his offering, he shall offer it before the L rd.
3:13	And he shall place his hand upon its head and he shall slaughter it before the tent of meeting, and Aaron's sons shall dash its blood on the altar roundabout.
3:14	And he shall present from it his offering, a fire-offering to the L rd, the fat that covers the innards and all the fat upon the innards.
3:15	And the two kidneys and the fat which is upon them, which is on the loins, and the lobe with [some of] the liver, aside from the kidneys, he shall remove it.
3:16	And the Cohein shall smoke them upon the altar, the food of a fire-offering for a sweet savor, all the fat for the L rd.
3:17	A perpetual statute for your generations in all your dwellings; all fat and all blood you shall not eat.
4
4:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
4:2	Speak to the children of Israel, saying: A soul, if he sin unwittingly (by transgression) of all the mitzvoth of the L rd [(of those negative commandments punishable by kareth ("cutting off") for willful transgression, and subject to a sin-offering for unwitting transgression)] which may not be done, and he do of [i.e., (even) part of] one of them [e.g., writing part of a name on Shabbath, like "Shem" from "Shemuel" or "Dan" from "Daniel"] —
4:3	If the anointed Cohein shall sin to the guilt of the people [(If the high-priest sins, it is "to the guilt of the people," for they depend upon him to atone for them and to pray for them)], then he shall offer for his sin which he has sinned a young bullock [three years old], unblemished, to the L rd, as a sin-offering.
4:4	And he shall bring the bullock to the door of the tent of meeting before the L rd, and he shall place his hand on the head of the bullock, and he shall slaughter the bullock before the L rd.
4:5	And the anointed Cohein shall take from the blood of the bullock and bring it to the tent of meeting [to the mishkan (and, in the Temple, to the heichal)].
4:6	And the Cohein shall dip his finger into the blood, and he shall sprinkle from the blood seven times before the L rd, before the parocheth of the holiness [i.e., in alignment between the staves of the ark. Though the high-priest has sinned, its holiness still inheres in it (see 17)].
4:7	And the Cohein shall put of the blood on the horns of the altar of the smoking of the incense before the L rd, which is in the tent of meeting; and all the [remaining] blood of the bullock he shall pour at the base of the altar of the burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting.
4:8	And all the fat of the bullock [(The Yom Kippur bullock is hereby included)] of the sin-offering [(This includes the "idolatry goats" as subject to the burning of kidneys, fats, and lobe)] he shall take from it [(before dismembering it)]: the fat which covers the innards and all the fat which is on the innards.
4:9	And the two kidneys and the fat that is upon them, which is on the loins, and the lobe with [some of] the liver, aside from the kidneys — he shall remove it.
4:10	As it is removed from the ox of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings [(Just as peace-offerings must be intended as such (lishmah), so this requires lishmah; and just as peace-offerings bring peace to the world, so does this)], and the Cohein shall smoke them on the altar of the burnt-offering.
4:11	And the skin of the bullock and all its flesh, with its head and with its legs, and its innards and its dung.
4:12	And he shall take the entire bullock outside the camp [outside the three camps (and, in the Temple, outside the city)] to a clean place, where the ashes [from the altar] are poured out; and he shall burn it on wood with fire. Where the ashes are poured out [(even if there are no ashes there)] shall it be burnt.
4:13	And if the whole congregation of Israel [the Sanhedrin] err, and a thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly [(If they erroneously rule something punishable by kareth to be permitted)], and they [the people, on the strength of their ruling] do one of all the mitzvoth of the L rd which are not to be done, and they are guilty —
4:14	If the sin become known wherein they have sinned, then the assembly shall offer a young bullock for a sin-offering, and they shall bring it before the tent of meeting.
4:15	And the elders of the congregation shall place their hands upon the head of the bullock before the L rd, and he shall slaughter the bullock before the L rd.
4:16	And the anointed Cohein shall bring of the blood of the bullock to the tent of meeting.
4:17	And the Cohein shall dip his finger from the blood, and he shall sprinkle seven times before the L rd before the parocheth [(but not, as in (6) "the parocheth of the holiness") Once all have sinned, the holiness departs.)]
4:18	And of the blood shall he put upon the horns of the altar which is before the L rd, which is in the tent of meeting; and all of the [remaining] blood shall he pour at the [western] base of the altar of the burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting.
4:19	And all of its fat shall he take off from it, and he shall smoke it upon the altar.
4:20	And he shall do with this bullock as he did with the bullock of the sin-offering [of the anointed Cohein]; so shall he do with this. And the Cohein shall make atonement for them and it shall be forgiven them.
4:21	And he shall take the bullock outside the camp, and he shall burn it as he burned the first bullock; it is the sin-offering for the assembly.
4:22	If (asher) a leader sin [("asher," similar to "ashrei" (fortunate). Fortunate is the generation whose leader takes it to heart to make atonement for his unwitting sin. (It goes without saying that he repents of his willful sins)], and he do one of all the mitzvoth of the L rd his G d, which are not to be done, unwittingly, and he be guilty —
4:23	If his sin becomes known to him wherein he has sinned, then he shall bring as his offering a kid of goats, a male without blemish.
4:24	And he shall place his hand on the head of the goat, and he shall slaughter it in the place where the burnt-offering is slaughtered before the L rd [i.e., northwards (1:11)]. It is a sin-offering [To be kasher, it must be offered as such (lishmah)]
4:25	And the Cohein shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger and he shall place it on the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering, and its [remaining] blood he shall pour at the base of the altar of the burnt-offering.
4:26	And all of its fat shall he smoke upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings [of a goat]; and the Cohein shall make atonement for him for his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.
4:27	And if a single soul sin unwittingly, of the people of the land, in doing it, one of the mitzvoth of the L rd which are not to be done, and he be guilty —
4:28	If his sin becomes known to him wherein he sinned, then he shall bring as his offering a kid of goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he has sinned.
4:29	And he shall place his hand on the head of the sin-offering, and he shall slaughter the sin-offering in the place of the burnt-offering.
4:30	And the Cohein shall take of its blood with his finger and he shall place it on the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering, and all of its [remaining] blood he shall pour at the base of the altar.
4:31	And all its fat shall he remove, as the fat was removed from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings [of a goat]. And the Cohein shall smoke it upon the altar as a sweet savor to the L rd; and the Cohein shall make atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.
4:32	And if a lamb he brings as his offering for a sin-offering, a female without blemish shall he bring it.
4:33	And he shall place his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and he shall slaughter it [specifically] as a sin-offering in the place where the burnt-offering is slaughtered.
4:34	And the Cohein shall take from the blood of the sin-offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering; and he shall pour out all its blood at the base of the altar.
4:35	And all its fat he shall remove, as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings [i.e., with the addition of the fat-tail]. And the Cohein shall smoke them upon the altar, upon the [fire made for the] fire-offerings of the L rd. And the Cohein shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.
5
5:1	And if a soul sin and hear the voice of an oath [i.e., if he were besworn to give testimony if he knows it], and he were a witness, having seen or known — if he does not tell, then he shall bear his sin.
5:2	Or if a soul touch any unclean thing [and, after becoming unclean, eat consecrated food or enter the sanctuary, willful violation being punishable by kareth] — whether it (the unclean thing) be the carcass of an unclean animal, or the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of an unclean creeping thing — and it [the uncleanliness] were hidden from him, and he were unclean and he be guilty [in eating consecrated food or in entering the sanctuary] —
5:3	Or if he touch the uncleanliness of man [(The allusion is to dead body uncleanliness)], for all his uncleanliness [including touching zavin or zavoth (men or women affected by a genital flux)] where he becomes unclean [(including touching one who cohabited with a niddah)] through it [(including swallowing the carcass of a (ritually) clean fowl)], and it were hidden from him, [i.e., he forgot that he had become unclean], and he (then) knew, and he be guilty [by eating consecrated food or entering the sanctuary],
5:4	Or if a soul swore, pronouncing with his lips, [but not in his heart alone] to do ill or to do good [to himself], for all that a man will pronounce with an oath, [including an oath concerning the past], and it were hidden from him, [and he transgressed his oath], and he (then) knew, and he be guilty in one of these — [then he brings an oleh veyored ("sliding scale") offering (but for violation of an oath in denial of a money claim, the offering is a guilt-offering.)]
5:5	Then it shall be, if he be guilty for one of these, then he shall confess wherein he has sinned.
5:6	And he shall bring (the offering for) his guilt to the L rd, for his sin which he has sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat-kid, for a sin-offering; and the Cohein shall make atonement for him for his sin.
5:7	And if his hand cannot attain enough for a lamb, then he shall bring (the offering of) his guilt wherein he has sinned, two turtle-doves or two young pigeons to the L rd, one for a sin-offering and one for a burnt-offering.
5:8	And he shall bring them to the Cohein, and he shall sacrifice the one for the sin-offering first [and then the burnt-offering. (First, pardon is secured; then the "gift" is presented.)] And he shall pinch its head alongside its oref (the back of the head sloping to the nape) [i.e., He pinches the nape], but he shall not sunder it (the head). [He pinches only one of the (shechitah) signs (gullet or windpipe)].
5:9	And he shall sprinkle from the blood of the sin-offering on the wall of the altar [by grasping the oref and "squirting" the blood upon the altar], and what remains of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar. It is a sin-offering. [It must be specifically intended as such.]
5:10	And the second one he shall make a burnt-offering as prescribed (1:14), and the Cohein shall make atonement for him for his sin which he has sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.
5:11	And if his hand does not attain to two turtle-doves or to two young pigeons, then he shall bring his offering wherein he has sinned, a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering; he shall not place oil upon it and he shall not put frankincense upon it, for it is a sin-offering, [which should not be ornate].
5:12	And he shall bring it to the Cohein, and the Cohein shall take a fistful from it, his entire fistful, as its remembrance; and he shall smoke it upon the altar, upon the [fire made for the] fire-offerings of the L rd. It is a sin-offering [and requires kemitzah (taking the fistful) and smoking lishmah].
5:13	And the Cohein shall make atonement for him, for his sin (al chatatho) that he has sinned [If he sinned when rich and set aside money for a lamb or a goat, and then became poor, he may bring two turtle-doves from part of that money. If he set aside money for two turtle-doves and then became poorer, he may bring a tenth of an ephah from part of that money. If he set aside money for a tenth of an ephah and then became rich, (our instance) he adds to the money and brings the offering of a rich man. Hence, "al chatatho" — lit., "in addition to (what was set aside for) his sin," as opposed to "mechatatho" — lit., "from (what was set aside for) his sin," mentioned in the other instances (6 and 10)], with one of these [three atonements relative to the means of the donor], and it shall be forgiven him, and it [what is left over from the fistful] shall be to the Cohein, as [with] a meal-offering [in general].
5:14	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
5:15	A soul, if he change [something from sacred to profane] and sin unwittingly [by deriving benefit] from the holy things of the L rd [i.e., those which are dedicated to His name (as opposed to lower order sanctities)], then he shall bring his guilt-offering to the L rd, a [two-year-old] ram, without blemish, from the flock, by your valuation, silver shekalim [i.e., It must be worth at least two selaim], according to the shekel of the sanctuary, for a guilt-offering.
5:16	And for what he has sinned in the holy thing [(the principal)] he shall pay, and its fifth he shall add to it, and he shall give it to the Cohein; and the Cohein shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt-offering, and it shall be forgiven him.
5:17	And if a soul sin and do one of all the mitzvoth of the L rd which may not be done [(and which is punishable by kareth)], and he not know [that he has definitely sinned (as when one ate a piece of meat and was later informed that one of the two pieces before him was forbidden, so that he might have eaten the forbidden piece)], and he be guilty (in that respect), then he shall bear his sin.
5:18	And he shall bring a ram without blemish, from the flock, by your valuation [see 15] for a guilt-offering to the Cohein; and the Cohein shall make atonement for him for his unwitting sin which he committed, for he did not know, and it shall be forgiven him. [But if he discovers later that he definitely sinned, he is not forgiven until he brings a sin-offering.]
5:19	It [(to exclude the guilt-offering of a Nazirite (Numbers 6:12)] is a guilt-offering [which requires a ram worth two selaim]; he has been guilty (ashom asham) to the L rd ["ashom asham" — to include (in the above) the guilt-offering (for violation) of a betrothed handmaid (19:20)]
5:20	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
5:21	If a soul sin and commit a profanation against the L rd [(When he "denies," he "denies" the L rd, who witnessed what was done)], and he deny to his neighbor a pledge, or a deposit [for business capital or as a loan] or a theft; or if he oppressed his neighbor [i.e., if he held back the wages of a hired laborer] —
5:22	Or if he find a lost object and deny it, and swear falsely in one of all [these things] wherein a man sins [and swears falsely, denying a money claim] —
5:23	And it shall be, when [he acknowledges, penitentially, that] he sinned and [that] he is guilty, then he shall return the theft that he has stolen, or the oppression wherein he has oppressed, or the pledge which was deposited with him, or the lost object which he found.
5:24	Or of all that he swears upon falsely — and he shall pay it at its head [i.e., he shall return the principal], and its fifths shall he add to it [i.e., If he gave the claimant the principal and swore that he had given him the fifth (and subsequently admitted that he had sworn falsely, the fifth is accounted a principal and) he pays a fifth on the fifth (and so, progressively,) until the principal is less than the value of a perutah]. To whom it belongs shall he give it on the day of his (acknowledgement of his) guilt.
5:25	And his guilt-offering shall he bring to the L rd, a ram without blemish from the flock, by your valuation, for a guilt-offering to the Cohein.
5:26	And the Cohein shall make atonement for him before the L rd, and it shall be forgiven him for one of all (the transgressions) that he does to incur guilt thereby.
Tzav
6
6:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
6:2	Command (tzav) Aaron and his sons ["tzav" connotes a prompting to zeal, for the immediate situation and for future generations. R. Shimon said: Scripture must prompt thus all the more where no profit is to be derived (the Cohanim not benefitting from the burnt-offering)]: This [(that it is permitted to smoke the fat and limbs the entire night, and that certain offerings must be taken down from the altar and others not)] is the law of the burnt-offering. It is the burnt-offering [(to exclude animals involved, actively or passively, in sodomy, and the like, which were invalidated before they entered the azarah (and which, if brought up on the altar must be taken down)] (It shall remain) on its fire-wood on the altar the entire night until the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.
6:3	And the Cohein shall put on his ["fit to size"] linen garment [the kutoneth], and linen breeches shall he put [directly] on his flesh [nothing intervening], and he shall lift [with a fire-pan] the ashes of the fire's consuming the burnt-offering on the altar [(If he finds unconsumed pieces he returns them to the altar)], and he shall put them beside the altar. [He takes a full fire-pan of the consumed inner pieces and puts them on the east of the ramp.]
6:4	And he shall take off his garments and don other garments [(This is not obligatory but derech eretz (proper conduct), so that he not soil the garments in which he ministers)], and he shall take out the ashes [when they accumulate on the altar to the point where there is not enough room for the wood pile (This, unlike the removal of the ashes above (3), is not a daily requirement)] outside the camp to a clean place.
6:5	And the fire of the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not go out. And the Cohein shall kindle wood on it every morning. And he shall arrange the burnt-offering upon it [The continual (daily) burnt-offering takes precedence], and he shall smoke upon it the fats of the peace-offerings.
6:6	A perpetual fire [the fire called "perpetual" (Exodus 27:20), that by which the menorah is kindled] shall be burning on the [outer] altar; it shall not go out [One who extinguishes the altar fire transgresses two negative commandments.]
6:7	And this is the law of the meal-offering, [that all of them require oil and frankincense]. The sons of Aaron shall bring it near [to the southwest corner of the altar], before the L rd, [in the west, towards the tent of meeting], in front of the altar [the south, where the ramp is].
6:8	And he shall take from it [from the combined mixture (of flour, oil, and frankincense), that there be a full issaron (a tenth) at the time of kemitzah], with his fistful, [that he not make a measure for the fistful], from the fine flour of the meal-offering [(it should not be mixed with another)] and its oil [(The fistful is taken from the place where the oil is thickest)], and all the frankincense which is on the meal-offering [(He collects the frankincense after taking the fistful and smokes it)], and he shall smoke it upon the altar, a sweet savor, its remembrance to the L rd.
6:9	And what is left of it shall be eaten by Aaron and his sons. It shall be eaten unleavened; in a holy place, in the court of the tent of meeting shall they eat it.
6:10	It shall not be baked with leaven, their portion [(Even what is left over may not be baked with leaven)] (Their portion) have I given it of My fire-offerings; it is holy of holies. It [the meal-offering of the sinner] is like the sin-offering [in that if he did not take the fistful lishmah it is pasul] and [a gift meal-offering is] like the guilt-offering [in that if he did not take the fistful lishmah it is kasher].
6:11	Every male [even one with a blemish] among the children of Aaron may eat it. It is a statute forever for your generations of the fire-offerings of the L rd. All [mundane foods or foods of lower order sanctity] that touch them (the meal-offerings) [and absorb aught of them] shall be sanctified [like them. If the meal-offering is pasul, they become pasul; if it is kasher, they must be eaten with the stringencies of the meal-offering].
6:12	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
6:13	This is the offering of Aaron and his sons [(The ordinary Cohanim, too, offer the tenth of an ephah, but only on the day of their investiture, whereas the high-priest does so every day)], which they shall offer up to the L rd on the day that he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour, a perpetual meal-offering — half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening.
6:14	On a griddle, with oil, shall it be made; soaked [scalded with hot (oil) to saturation] shall you bring it, baked many times [(After scalding it he bakes it in an oven and then he fries it on a griddle)]. A meal-offering of pieces shall you offer it, a sweet savor to the L rd.
6:15	And The Cohein that is anointed from his sons in his place shall offer it, a statute forever for the L rd; it shall be entirely smoked. [No fistful is taken. The same applies to all gift meal-offerings of a Cohein.]
6:16	And every meal-offering of a Cohein shall be entire, [exclusively for the L rd]; it shall not be eaten.
6:17	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
6:18	Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying: This is the law of the sin-offering. In the place where the burnt-offering is slaughtered, there shall the sin-offering be slaughtered, before the L rd; it is holy of holies.
6:19	The Cohein who offers it as a sin-offering [(to exclude one who is not clean at the time of the sprinkling of the blood)] shall eat it. In a holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting.
6:20	All that touches its flesh shall be sanctified [see 11]. And what shall be sprinkled of its blood upon a garment, that [place] which has been sprinkled upon, you shall wash in a holy place [the azarah].
6:21	And an earthen vessel in which it is cooked shall be broken [(because what is absorbed becomes nothar ("leftover" holy food)]. And if it is cooked in a copper vessel, it shall be scoured and rinsed with water [to discharge what was absorbed.]
6:22	Every male among the Cohanim may eat it; it is holy of holies.
6:23	And every [(all kodshim are included)] sin-offering whereof any of its blood is brought to the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place shall not be eaten [(If he brings the blood of an "outer" sin-offering into the sanctuary, it becomes pasul)]; in fire shall it be burned.
7
7:1	And this is the law of the guilt-offering; it is holy of holies. [It is offered, but its substitute is not offered.]
7:2	In the place where they slaughter the burnt-offering [(A communal burnt-offering is also slaughtered in the north)] shall they slaughter the guilt-offering, and its blood shall he dash on the altar roundabout.
7:3	And all of its fat shall he offer of it: the fat-tail [(for only a ram or a lamb is brought as a guilt-offering)] and the fat that covers the innards.
7:4	And the two kidneys and the fat which is upon them, which is on the loins, and the lobe with [some of] the liver, aside from the kidneys, he shall remove it.
7:5	And the Cohein shall smoke them upon the altar, a fire-offering to the L rd; it is a guilt-offering [(until, in certain circumstances, its name is removed from it by its being consigned to pasture until it sustains a blemish)]
7:6	Every male among the Cohanim may eat it. In a holy place shall it be eaten; it is holy of holies.
7:7	As is the sin-offering, so is the guilt-offering. There is one law for them: the Cohein who [may] make atonement therewith, to him shall it be [(to exclude from sharing in it one who has immersed in the daytime (and is not clean until the evening), one who lacks atonement (until he brings a sacrifice), and a mourner (before the burial of his kin)].
7:8	And the Cohein who offers up the burnt-offering of a man, the hide of the burnt-offering which he offered up is the Cohein's; to him shall it be.
7:9	And every meal-offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is made in the stewing-pan and on the griddle, to the Cohein who offers it up, to him [i.e., to the priestly family officiating that day] shall it be.
7:10	And every meal-offering mixed with oil [(a gift meal-offering)] or dry [(the sinner's meal-offering and the meal-offering of jealousy (Numbers 5:15), which contain no oil)], to all the sons of Aaron shall it be, one man as well as another.
7:11	And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings which one shall offer to the L rd.
7:12	If for thanksgiving [for a miracle wrought for him, e.g., recovering from an illness] he shall offer it, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving, unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and [unleavened] cakes of soaked fine flour mixed with oil [(ten cakes of each of the four kinds)].
7:13	With cakes of leavened bread shall he offer his offering, with the sacrifice of his thanksgiving peace-offerings. [(The bread does not become consecrated until the sacrifice is slaughtered)].
7:14	And he shall offer of it one [bread] of each offering [i.e., of each kind of the four breads], a gift-offering to the L rd. To the Cohein who dashes (against the altar) the blood of the peace-offerings, to him shall it be.
7:15	And the flesh of the sacrifice of his thanksgiving peace-offerings [(to include for being eaten on the same day and the succeeding night the sin-offering, guilt-offering, and ram of the Nazirite, and the festival offering of the fourteenth of Nissan)], on the day of his offering shall it [and its bread] be eaten. He shall not leave over of it until morning.
7:16	And if a vow or a gift [(and not thanksgiving for a miracle)] is the sacrifice of his offering, [(then it does not require bread and it may be eaten for two days)], on the day that he offers his sacrifice shall it be eaten; and on the next day, that which remains of it [from the first day] shall be eaten.
7:17	And what remains from the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day, with fire shall it be burned.
7:18	And if there be [thought (by the offerer) to be] eaten of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings on the third day [i.e., If, when it is sacrificed he thinks to eat it on the third day], it shall not be accepted. He that offers it shall not bethink himself [to eat it on the third day]. It shall be piggul ("rejected"), and the soul that eats of it [even within the permitted time] shall bear its sin.
7:19	And the flesh [of consecrated peace-offerings] that shall touch any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire. And the flesh [(to include as permitted what remains inside (the permitted eating bounds) of a limb that has projected outside)] — everyone that is clean [and not only the owner] may eat the flesh.
7:20	And the soul that eats flesh of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings which is the L rd's, and his uncleanliness is upon him [i.e., if he himself (as opposed to the offering) is unclean], that soul shall be cut off from its people [(but a clean person who eats an unclean offering does not incur kareth)].
7:21	And if a soul touch any unclean thing, of the uncleanliness of a man or of an unclean beast, or of any unclean abomination, and he eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings, which is the L rd's, then that soul shall be cut off from its people.
7:22	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
7:23	Speak to the children of Israel, saying: All fat (cheilev) of ox or sheep or goat you shall not eat.
7:24	And the fat of (a beast that is) neveilah (carrion) or the fat of treifah ("torn") may be used for all service [(The fat of neveilah does not render one unclean)], and you shall not eat it. [(The interdict of eating neveilah and treifah "takes" upon that of eating cheilev, so that the eater transgresses two negative commandments)].
7:25	For all who eat fat of the beast, of which one presents a fire-offering to the L rd, the soul that eats shall be cut off from its people.
7:26	And all blood you shall not eat, in all of your habitations [(the interdict being a function of the body and not of the land)], of bird and of beast [(to exclude the blood of fish and locusts)].
7:27	Any soul that eats any blood, that soul shall be cut off from its people.
7:28	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
7:29	Speak to the children of Israel, saying: He who presents the sacrifice of his peace-offerings to the L rd shall bring his offering to the L rd from the sacrifice of his peace-offerings.
7:30	His hands shall bring the fire-offerings of the L rd, [the hand of the owner above, with the fat and breasts in it, and the hand of the Cohein below, and he (the Cohein) lifts them]. The fat on the breast shall he (a Cohein) bring it [from the slaughtering site, so that when it is placed in the hand of the Cohein who waves it, the breast is above and the fat below; and, after the waving, it is placed — breast below and fat above — in the hand of a third Cohein who smokes it] — the breast, to wave it as a wave-offering before the L rd [i.e., the breast is not part of the fire-offering, but part of the wave-offering].
7:31	And the Cohein shall smoke the fat upon the altar, and [i.e., after which] the breast shall be for Aaron and for his sons.
7:32	And the right shok (from knee to thigh) shall you give as an offering to the Cohein from the sacrifices of your peace-offerings.
7:33	He who offers the blood of the peace-offerings and the fat, of the sons of Aaron [i.e., he who is fit to offer them (to exclude one who is unclean at the time of the sprinkling of the blood or the smoking of the fats)], to him shall be the right shok as a portion.
7:34	For the breast of the waving [(forward and back)] and the thigh of the lifting [(up and down)] have I taken from the children of Israel from the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, and I have given them to Aaron the Cohein and to his sons as an everlasting statute from the children of Israel.
7:35	This is the (portion of the) anointment of Aaron and the anointment of his sons from the fire-offerings of the L rd on the day He drew them near to minister to the L rd.
7:36	Which the L rd commanded to give to them on the day He anointed them, from the children of Israel, a statute forever, throughout their generations.
7:37	This is the law of the burnt-offering, of the meal-offering, and of the sin-offering, and of the guilt-offering, and of the offering of investiture [of the priesthood], and of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings.
7:38	Which the L rd commanded Moses in Mount Sinai on the day that He commanded the children of Israel to present their offerings to the L rd in the desert of Sinai.
8
8:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
8:2	[This section was stated seven days before the erection of the mishkan (there being no "before" and "after" in the Torah)] Take Aaron [("Take" him with words, predispose him)] and his sons with him, and the garments, and the oil of anointment, and the bullock of the sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread [(see Exodus 28), the instructions being reiterated as a prompting to zeal on the first day of the investiture].
8:3	And assemble all of the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting [(this being one of the places where the "small" contained the "great")].
8:4	And Moses did as the L rd commanded him, and the congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of meeting.
8:5	And Moses said to the congregation: This [what you will see me doing] is [not for my honor nor for my brother's, but it is] the thing which the L rd has commanded to do.
8:6	And Moses drew near Aaron and his sons and he washed them with water.
8:7	And he put upon him [(see Exodus 29)] the kutoneth, and he girded him with the avneit, and he clothed him with the me'il, and he put upon him the ephod, and he girded him with the cheishev of the ephod, and he bound it to him therewith.
8:8	And he placed upon him the choshen, and he put in the choshen the urim and the tumim [(see Exodus 28:30)]
8:9	And he put the mitznefeth upon his head; and he set upon the mitznefeth, upon its forefront, the golden tzitz, the holy crown, as the L rd had commanded Moses [(see Exodus 28:37)]
8:10	And Moses took the oil of anointment and he anointed the mishkan and all that was in it, and he sanctified them.
8:11	And Moses sprinkled of it upon the altar seven times; and he anointed the altar and all of its vessels, and the laver and its base, to sanctify them.
8:12	And he poured from the oil of anointment upon the head of Aaron, and he anointed him to sanctify him.
8:13	And Moses drew near the sons of Aaron, and he clothed them with kutanoth, and he girded them with the avneit, and he bound migbaoth upon them, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
8:14	And he presented the bullock of the sin-offering, and Aaron and his sons placed their hands on the head of the bullock of the sin-offering.
8:15	And he slaughtered (it), and Moses took the blood, and he put it on the horns of the altar roundabout with his finger. And he purified the altar [(He cleaned and purified it from its state of profaneness to enter into that of holiness)], and the (remaining) blood he poured out at the base of the altar, and he sanctified it [by this service] to make atonement upon it [i.e., to effect upon it all the atonements thenceforward].
8:16	And he took all the fat that was upon the innards, and the lobe with [some of] the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses smoked it on the altar.
8:17	And the bullock, with its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, he burned with fire outside the camp, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
8:18	And he presented the ram of the burnt-offering, and Aaron and his sons placed their hands on the head of the ram.
8:19	And he slaughtered (it), and Moses dashed the blood upon the altar roundabout.
8:20	And he cut the ram into its pieces, and Moses smoked the head, and the pieces, and the suet.
8:21	And the innards and the legs he washed with water, and Moses smoked the whole ram upon the altar. It is a burnt-offering for a sweet savor, a fire-offering to the L rd, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
8:22	And he presented the second ram, the ram of investiture (miluim) [the ram of shelamim, which "fill and complete" (memalin umashlimin) the induction of the Cohanim]; and Aaron and his sons placed their hands on the head of the ram.
8:23	And he slaughtered (it), and Moses took of its blood and placed it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the thumb of his right foot.
8:24	And he brought forward Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the thumb of their right foot; and Moses dashed the blood upon the altar roundabout.
8:25	And he took the fat and the fat-tail and all the fat on the innards and the lobe with [some of] the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and the right shok.
8:26	And from the basket of unleavened bread which was before the L rd he took one unleavened cake and a cake of oiled bread [see 6:14] and one wafer, and he put them on the fats and on the right shok.
8:27	And he placed the whole upon the hands of Aaron and upon the hands of his sons, and he waved them, a wave-offering before the L rd.
8:28	And Moses took them from their hands and smoked them on the altar after the burnt-offering. They are an investiture-offering for a sweet savor; it is a fire-offering to the L rd.
8:29	And Moses took the breast and waved it, a wave-offering before the L rd from the ram of the investiture. To Moses was it for a portion, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
8:30	And Moses took of the oil of anointment and of the blood which was upon the altar, and he sprinkled it upon Aaron, upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him. And he sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.
8:31	And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons: Cook the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting, and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of investiture, as I have commanded, saying: Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
8:32	And what is left over of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn with fire.
8:33	And from the door of the tent of meeting you shall not go out seven days, until the day of the fulfillment of the days of your investiture; for seven days shall He invest your hands.
8:34	As He has done this day, so has the L rd commanded to do [all seven days] to make atonement for you.
8:35	And at the door of the tent of meeting shall you sit day and night seven days. And you shall keep the charge of the L rd that you not die [(Failing to do so, you incur the penalty of death)]; for thus have I been commanded.
8:36	And Aaron and his sons did all the things that the L rd commanded by the hand of Moses, [not deviating to the right or to the left.]
Shemini
9
9:1	And it was on the eighth day [of the investiture, the first of Nissan, the day of the erection of the mishkan] that Moses called to Aaron and to his sons and to the elders of Israel, [to impress upon them that Aaron and his sons entered into the high-priesthood by divine command and not of their own initiative].
9:2	And he said to Aaron: Take for yourself a bull-calf for a sin-offering, [Aaron being apprised that this calf was his atonement for the golden calf which he had made], and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer them before the L rd.
9:3	And to the children of Israel shall you speak, saying: Take a he-goat for a sin-offering and a calf and a lamb of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt-offering.
9:4	And an ox and a ram for peace-offerings to sacrifice before the L rd, and a meal-offering mixed with oil; for today the L rd will appear to you [to repose His shechinah in the work of your hands (for which reason these offerings are obligatory on this day)].
9:5	And they brought what Moses had commanded in front of the tent of meeting, and all the congregation drew near and stood before the L rd.
9:6	And Moses said: This is the thing which the L rd commanded that you should do so that there appear to you the glory of the L rd.
9:7	And Moses said to Aaron: Draw near to the altar [(Aaron was ashamed and afraid to draw near, whereupon Moses said to him: Why are you ashamed? For this were you chosen!)], and offer your sin-offering [the bull-calf] and your burnt-offering [the ram], and make atonement for yourself and for the people; and offer the offering of the people [the he-goat, the calf, and the lamb], and make atonement for them, as the L rd has commanded.
9:8	And Aaron drew near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin-offering which was his.
9:9	And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood, and he put it on the horns of the altar; and he poured out the blood at the foundation of the altar.
9:10	And the fat and the kidneys and the lobe with [some of] of the liver of the sin-offering he caused to smoke upon the altar, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
9:11	And the flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.
9:12	And he slaughtered the burnt-offering, and Aaron's sons presented the blood to him, and he dashed it against the altar roundabout.
9:13	And the burnt-offering they presented to him with its pieces and the head, and he smoked them upon the altar.
9:14	And he washed the innards and the legs, and he smoked them upon the burnt-offering on the altar.
9:15	And he presented the offering of the people, and he took the goat of the sin-offering which was the people's, and he slaughtered it, and he offered it as a sin-offering, like the first [i.e., like his calf].
9:16	And he presented the burnt-offering, and he offered it according to the ordinance [see Chapter 1].
9:17	And he presented the meal-offering and he filled his hand from it [viz., the kemitzah], and he smoked it upon the altar, aside from the burnt-offering of the morning. [He offered all of these after the continual burnt-offering.]
9:18	And he slaughtered the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of the peace-offerings which was the people's, and Aaron's sons presented the blood to him, and he dashed it against the altar roundabout.
9:19	And the fats of the ox and of the ram, the fat-tail, and [the fat] that covered [the innards], and the kidneys, and the lobe with [some of] the liver.
9:20	And they put the fats on the breasts [(After the waving, the Cohein who had waved them (with the breast above and the fat below) put them into the hand of the Cohein who was to smoke them, breast below and fat above)], and he smoked the fats on the altar.
9:21	And the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved as a wave-offering before the L rd, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
9:22	And Aaron lifted his hands to the people and he blessed them [the priestly blessing], and he came down from offering the sin-offering and the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings.
9:23	And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting [for Moses to teach Aaron the service of the incense (which is offered there)], and they went out and blessed the people. [They said (Psalms 90:17): "And let the pleasantness of the L rd be upon us." Up to that point the Shechinah had not rested in the mishkan. Seeing their distress over this, Moses had said to them (9:6): "This (the sacrificial service that follows) is the thing that you should do so that there appear to you the glory of the L rd"], and, [Aaron having performed that service], the glory of the L rd appeared to all the people.
9:24	And a fire came forth from before the L rd, and it consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fats. And all the people saw and they exalted (the L rd), and they fell upon their faces.
10
10:1	And the sons of Aaron, Nadav and Avihu, took, each of them his coal-pan, and they put fire therein, and they laid incense thereon; and they offered before the L rd a strange fire, which He had not commanded them.
10:2	And a fire came out from before the L rd and it consumed them, and they died before the L rd.
10:3	And Moses said to Aaron: This is what the L rd spoke [(Exodus 29:43): "And I shall be appointed there (in the tent of meeting) for the children of Israel, venikdash bichvodi" — Read it "bimechubadai" (i.e., "and it will be sanctified by My honored ones")], saying: "With My near ones will I be sanctified, and before all the people will I be glorified." And Aaron kept his peace.
10:4	And Moses called to Mishael and to Eltzafan, the sons of Uziel, the uncle of Aaron [Uziel was Amram's brother (6:18)]. And he said to them: Draw near; carry your brothers from before the sanctuary outside of the camp [(as one would say: Remove the body from before the bride so as not to spoil the occasion.)]
10:5	And they drew near, and they carried them in their [the dead ones'] tunics [(Their garments were not burned. Two "threads" of fire entered their nostrils and killed them)] outside the camp, as Moses had spoken.
10:6	And Moses said to Aaron and to Elazar and to Ithamar, his sons: Your hair do not grow long [(whence it is derived that a mourner may not cut his hair.) But you, do not "dampen the joy" of the Holy One Blessed be He], and your garments do not rend, that you not die and He be wroth with the entire congregation. And let your brethren, the entire house of Israel, mourn the burning that the L rd has burned [(whence it is derived that it is incumbent upon all to mourn the suffering of sages.)]
10:7	And from the door of the tent of meeting do not go out, lest you die; for the anointing oil of the L rd is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.
10:8	And the L rd spoke to Aaron, saying:
10:9	Wine or strong drink do not drink, you and your sons with you, when you come to the tent of meeting, so that you not die, an everlasting statute throughout your generations.
10:10	So that you distinguish between the holy and the profane [(If a Cohein ministers while inebriated, his service is invalid)], and between the unclean and the clean.
10:11	And to teach the children of Israel all the statutes that the L rd spoke to them by the hand of Moses.
10:12	And Moses spoke to Aaron and to Elazar and to Ithamar, his remaining sons [("remaining" from death. They, too, were to have died because of the sin of the golden calf, but Moses' prayer (Deuteronomy 9:20) annulled half the decree)]: Take the meal-offering remaining from the fire-offerings of the L rd [the meal-offering of the eighth day and the meal-offering of Nachshon] and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is holy of holies.
10:13	And you shall eat it in a holy place, for it is your portion and the portion of your sons from the fire-offerings of the L rd [(Daughters have no portion in kodshim (consecrated foods)]; for thus have I been commanded [that they shall eat it in a state of aninuth (before the burial of their kin, even though this is normally forbidden)].
10:14	And the breast of the waving and the shok of the lifting shall you eat in a clean place [(These lower order offerings, as opposed to the preceding holy of holies, need not be eaten in a holy place (within the court), but it suffices that they be eaten in a place that is clean (of lepers, i.e., within the camp of Israel)], you and your sons [(having a portion)] and your daughters with you [(the daughters not having a portion, but permitted to eat it as a gift)]. For as your portion and the portion of your sons are they given from the sacrifices of the peace-offerings of the children of Israel.
10:15	The shok of the lifting and the breast of the waving, upon the fire-offerings of the fats shall they bring [(the fats being below at the time of waving)], to wave a wave-offering before the L rd. And it shall be for you and for your sons with you as a statute forever, as the L rd has commanded.
10:16	And for the goat of the sin-offering [the goat of the additional offerings of the New Moon] Moses inquired, inquired, and, behold, it was burned [(two inquiries: Why has this goat been burned, and why have the other goats (the he-goat [9:3] and that of Nachshon [Numbers 7:16] been eaten?)] And he was wroth with Elazar and Ithamar the remaining sons of Aaron [(Out of deference to Aaron he turned his face to the sons in anger)] to say [(He said to them: Answer my words)]:
10:17	Why did you not eat the sin-offering in the holy place? [Is it possible that it was taken outside of the (court) curtains and (thereby) became pasul] because it is holy of holies? [They answered: No. — whereupon he said: Why, then, did you not eat it] when He has given it to you to forgive the sin of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the L rd? ["the Cohanim eating and the offerers receiving atonement", (the Rosh Chodesh goat [as opposed to the two others, whose purpose was not atonement,) atoning for uncleanliness of the sanctuary and its holy things)]
10:18	Behold, its blood was not brought within the sanctuary [in which instance you would have been obliged to burn it (see 6:23)]. You should then have eaten it in the holy place as I commanded you [in respect to the meal-offering (12), even though you are onenim!]
10:19	And Aaron spoke ["with heart"] to Moses [(knowing that Moses' words were really meant for him and that his sons were maintaining a deferential silence)]: Now did they this day offer their sin-offering and their burnt-offering before the L rd! [Moses had said to them: Is it possible that you sprinkled its blood being onenim! (the service of an onein being pasul) — to which Aaron replied: Is it they, ordinary priests, who offered the sacrifice? Is it not I who did so? (the high-priest sacrificing even when he is an onein)] Now if there had befallen me [even the death of other kin for whom I must become an onein (see Chapter 21)], such as these [my sons], and I had eaten the sin-offering this day [(an onein is permitted to eat at night)], would it be good in the eyes of the L rd! [(If you have heard (from the L rd) that this (such eating) is permitted with kodshim for a particular occasion (the investiture), this is no license for permitting it in "ongoing" kodshim (such as the Rosh Chodesh goat)].
10:20	And Moses heard, and it was good in his eyes. [He admitted (that he had heard this from the L rd but had forgotten) instead of "covering up" (by saying that he had not heard)].
11
11:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses and to Aaron [(Moses to tell Aaron)] to say to them [(Aaron to tell Elazar and Ithamar)]:
11:2	Speak to the children of Israel, saying [(All of the above were made equal in this embassy for having remained silent and accepted G d's decree (the death of Nadav and Avihu) with love)]: This [(Moses took hold of the animal and showed it to Israel)] is the animal (chayyah) [(connoting "chayyim" (life) — Because Israel cleaves to the L rd and merits (eternal) life, it is (to that end) separated from what is unclean and given mitzvoth)] that you may eat, of every beast that is on the earth [("beast" is in the class of "animal")]:
11:3	Whatever has parted hooves, and whose hooves are wholly cloven, and which chews its cud [lit., "which brings up its cud" (to chew again)] in the beast [(including an embryo found in the mother)] it shall you eat [(a positive commandment added to the negative (below) to make for "double" transgression in the instance of non-observance)]
11:4	Only this shall you not eat of those that chew the cud and of those whose hooves are parted: the camel, because it chews the cud and its hoof is not parted, it is unclean to you.
11:5	And the coney, because it chews the cud but has not parted hooves, it is unclean to you.
11:6	And the hare, because it chews the cud but has not parted hooves, it is unclean to you.
11:7	And the swine, because its hooves are parted and it is cloven-footed, but it does not chew the cud, it is unclean to you.
11:8	Of their flesh you shall not eat [(The exhortation applies to flesh, but not to bones, sinews, horns, or hooves)], and their carcass you shall not touch [on a festival]; they are unclean to you [(Do not make yourself unclean through them and (thus) disqualify yourself from appearing in the Temple on the festival)].
11:9	This may you eat of all that is in the waters: All that have fins and scales in the water, in the seas and in the rivers — those may you eat.
11:10	And all that do not have fins and scales in the seas and in the rivers, of every sheretz of the waters [(sheretz) a low creature that creeps and moves along the ground], and of every living creature that is in the waters — they are detestable to you.
11:11	And detestable shall they be to you [(This is to include mixtures where their taste is discernible)]. Of their flesh you shall not eat [(The exhortation does not apply to fins and bones)], and their carcass shall you hold in detestation [(to include midges filtered from their native element)].
11:12	Whatever has no fins and scales in the water [(but not something that "sheds" them in being removed from the water)] is detestable to you.
11:13	And these shall you hold in detestation of the fowl. They shall not be eaten [(One may not feed them to minors)]; they are detestable: the great vulture, and the bearded vulture, and the osprey.
11:14	And the kite and the falcon after its kind. ["after its kind" denotes a class which, though containing some members which may differ in name or appearance, is, notwithstanding, one species.)]
11:15	Every raven after its kind.
11:16	And the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the sea-mew, and the hawk after its kind.
11:17	And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl.
11:18	And the horned owl, and the pelican, and the carrion-vulture.
11:19	And the [white] stork, and the heron after its kind, and the lapwing and the bat.
11:20	All creeping things that fly, which walk on four [such as flies, hornets, gnats, and locusts,] are detestable to you.
11:21	Only this may you eat of all creeping things that fly, which walk on four — that which has kera'aim [foot-like projections] above its feet [near its neck] with which to spring from the earth.
11:22	These of them you may eat: the arbeh after its kind, and the salam after its kind, and the chargol after its kind, and the chagav after its kind.
11:23	And every creeping thing that flies, which has four legs, it is detestable to you [(but if it has five, it is clean)].
11:24	And by [touching] these [that follow] you shall become unclean; all who touch their carcass will be unclean until evening.
11:25	And everyone that carries of their carcass shall wash his clothing, and he shall be unclean until the evening. [(Carrying-uncleanliness is more stringent than touching-uncleanliness in that it requires washing of clothing.)]
11:26	By [touching (24)] every beast whose hoof is parted but is not cloven-footed, [like the camel, whose hoof is parted above but joined below] or does not chew the cud. They are unclean to you; everyone who touches them (i.e. their carcass) shall be unclean.
11:27	And all that walk upon their soles [e.g., dog, bear, cat], among all animals which walk on four, they are unclean to you. All who touch their carcass will be unclean until the evening.
11:28	And he that carries their carcass shall wash his clothes, and he shall be unclean until the evening; they are unclean to you.
11:29	And this to you is what is unclean [i.e., which renders you unclean by touching them (vis-à-vis the eating of terumah and kodshim and entering the sanctuary)] among the creeping things that creep upon the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kind.
11:30	And the gecko, and the land-crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand-lizard, and the chameleon.
11:31	These are what are unclean to you among all that creep. Everyone who touches them in their death will be unclean until the evening.
11:32	And all (vessels) upon which there falls of them in their death shall be unclean: of all vessels of wood, or garment, or skin, or sack. Any vessel with which work is done shall be put into water, and it shall be unclean [even after immersion] until the evening [for purposes of terumah], and then, [with the setting of the sun] it shall be clean.
11:33	And every earthen vessel where there shall fall of them into its midst [(an earthen vessel becomes unclean only through its interior)], whatever is in its midst shall [in turn] become unclean, and it shall you break [(It cannot be rendered clean in a mikveh.)]
11:34	["whatever is in its midst shall be unclean"] of all the food [(but not vessels) that is in it] which may be eaten [in one swallow (the size of an egg)], upon which water [and all drink] comes [(after the fruit has been picked)]; and all drink that may be drunk in every (such) vessel shall be unclean.
11:35	And all that there shall fall of their carcass upon it shall be unclean; whether oven or stove [(hollow, movable earthenware vessels with the opening on top)], it shall be torn down [(ritual immersion not availing for earthenware)]; they are unclean. And they shall be unclean to you [("to you":) If one wishes to preserve them in their state of uncleanliness he may do so.)]
11:36	Only a spring or a pit where waters are gathered shall be clean [i.e., they are not susceptible of uncleanliness (or: he who immerses in them "shall be clean")]. But he who touches their carcass (the carcass of the animals mentioned above) shall be unclean, [even if he does so while immersed in the spring or the mikveh].
11:37	And if there fall of their carcass on any variety of seed which is to be sown, it is clean [(Scripture apprises us (see 38) that it is not considered food susceptible of uncleanliness until water comes upon it)].
11:38	And if water [or other liquids] be placed upon a(n) [uprooted] seed [or it fall into water], and aught of their carcass fall on it [(even after the water has dried)], it is unclean to you.
11:39	And if there die of the beast which is yours to eat, he that touches its carcass [(but not its bones, sinews, horns, hooves, or skin)] shall be unclean until the evening.
11:40	And he who eats of its carcass [i.e., one who carries or touches the amount of carcass to which the term "eating" can be applied (i.e., an olive-size)] shall wash his clothes and he shall be unclean until the evening. And he who carries its carcass shall wash his clothes and he shall be unclean until the evening.
11:41	And every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth is detestable [(to exclude the insects in peas and beans, which do not creep upon the earth but within the food (Once they come out, however, and creep upon the earth, they are forbidden)]; it shall not be eaten [The feeder incurs punishment as the eater does.]
11:42	All [(including worms and the like)] that go upon the belly [i.e., snakes] and all that go upon four [i.e., scorpions], until all [including beetles and the like] that are many-footed [i.e., centipedes], of all creeping things that creep upon the earth, you shall not eat them, for they are detestable.
11:43	Do not make your souls detestable by [eating] every creeping thing that creeps, and do not make yourselves unclean by [eating] them, that you be rendered unclean by them. [(If you make yourselves unclean by them on earth, I shall render you unclean for the world to come and for the heavenly tribunal.)]
11:44	[Just as I am holy,] for I am the L rd your G d, make yourselves holy, and you will be holy, [for I will sanctify you above and in the world to come.] For I am holy, and do not make your souls unclean, [transgressing many negative commandments, each punishable by stripes (e.g., "If one ate a putitha (a kind of reptile) he receives stripes four times, etc.")] with every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.
11:45	For I am the L rd, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt [so that you accept My mitzvoth], to be a G d to you. And you shall be holy, for I am holy.
11:46	This is the law of the beast and the bird and of every living creature that swarms in the water and of every creature that creeps on the earth.
11:47	To distinguish [(It is not enough to "learn" about them; you must have perfect "recognition" of them.)] between the unclean [i.e., what is "unclean" to you (e.g., cutting half the windpipe)] and the clean [i.e., what is "clean" to you (e.g., cutting most of the windpipe)], and between the animal [(with certain treifah signs)] which may be eaten, and the animal [(with other treifah signs)] which may not be eaten.

12:1	And the L rd said to Moses, saying:
12:2	Speak to the children of Israel, saying: If a woman give forth seed [(Just as man's creation followed that of beast and fowl, so his law follows that of beast and fowl)] ("If a woman give forth seed") [(Even if she bore something pulpy and semen-like, she becomes unclean with childbirth-uncleanliness.)] and she bear a male, she shall be unclean seven days. As the days of her menstrual flow [(even if her womb opened without blood)] shall she be unclean.
12:3	And on the eighth day he shall circumcise the flesh of his foreskin.
12:4	And thirty days and three days she shall abide in the blood of cleanliness. [(Even though she sees blood, she is clean.)] All that is holy [including terumah] she shall not touch [(an exhortation against eating terumah)] [for her immersion (vis-à-vis kodshim) does not "take" until sunset of the fortieth day, on the morrow of which she brings her atonement offering], and into the sanctuary she shall not come until the fulfillment of the days of her purification.
12:5	And if a female she bear, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her menstrual state, and sixty days and six days shall she abide in the blood of cleanliness.
12:6	And when the days of her purification are fulfilled, for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb in its first year for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon or a turtle-dove for a sin-offering, to the door of the tent of meeting, to the Cohein.
12:7	And he shall offer it [the sin-offering (Only the sin-offering is indispensable for her eating kodshim)] before the L rd and make atonement for her, and she shall be cleansed [(whence it is seen that before this she is regarded as unclean)] from the source of her blood. This is the law for the woman who bears, whether a male or a female.
12:8	And if she has not means enough for a lamb, then she shall take two turtle-doves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt-offering and one for a sin-offering [(Note: The sin-offering is offered first; "burnt-offering" is just read first.)], and the Cohein shall make atonement for her and she shall be clean.
13
13:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying:
13:2	A man, if there be in the skin of his flesh se'eth (a rising) or sapachath or bahereth (a bright spot) [types of plague-spots, one brighter than the other], and it become in the skin of his flesh a plague-spot of leprosy, then he shall be brought to Aaron the Cohein or to one of his sons, the Cohanim [(It is a Scriptural decree that only a Cohein rules on the cleanliness or uncleanliness of plague-spots)].
13:3	And the Cohein shall see the plague-spot in the skin of the flesh. If hair [at least two hairs] in the plague-spot had turned [from black to] white, and the appearance of the plague-spot is deeper than the skin of his flesh [(as things in the sun seem deeper than those in the shadow)], it is a plague-spot of leprosy. And the Cohein shall see it and declare him unclean [(He shall say to him: "You are unclean.")]
13:4	And if it is a white bahereth in the skin of his flesh, and its appearance is not deeper than the skin, and its hair had not turned white, then the Cohein shall quarantine the plague-spot for seven days, [not to be looked at until the end of the week].
13:5	And the Cohein shall see it on the seventh day; and if the plague-spot appears as it did before [in appearance and size], if the plague-spot did not spread in the skin, then the Cohein shall quarantine it for a second seven days, [but if it spread in the first week, he is a confirmed leper].
13:5	And the Cohein shall see it on the seventh day again; and if the plague-spot is dim, and the plague-spot has not spread in the skin, then the Cohein shall declare him clean [(but if it remained the same or spread, he is unclean)]; it is a mispachath [a type of clean plague-spot], and he shall wash his clothes and be clean [(Since he required quarantine he is called "unclean" and requires immersion.)]
13:7	And if the mispachath spreads in the skin after he has shown himself to the Cohein for his cleansing, then he shall show himself a second time to the Cohein.
13:8	And the Cohein shall see: If the mispachath has spread in the skin, then the Cohein shall declare him unclean, [whereupon he is a confirmed leper, requiring birds, shaving, and the offering (see Chapter 14)]. It [this mispachath] is leprosy.
13:9	A plague-spot of leprosy, if it be in a man, then he shall be brought to the Cohein.
13:10	And the Cohein shall see, and behold, a white se'eth in the skin, and it has turned the hair white, and the healthiness of living flesh within the rising, [part of the whiteness within the se'eth having assumed the appearance of flesh, this, too, is a sign of uncleanliness — white hair (even) without healthy flesh, or healthy flesh (even) without white hair. (Note: Though "healthy flesh" is stated only in reference to se'eth, it is a sign of uncleanliness in all plague-spots.)]
13:11	It is old leprosy in the skin of his flesh [(There is an old wound, full of pus, beneath the healthy flesh, so that the healthy flesh is no reason to declare him clean]. And the Cohein shall declare him unclean; he shall not quarantine him, for he is unclean.
13:12	And if the leprosy blossom in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of the plague-spot, from his head until his feet, to all the sight of the eyes of the Cohein [(to exclude a Cohein whose sight has dimmed)],
13:13	And the Cohein shall see, and behold, the leprosy has covered all of his flesh, then he shall declare the plague-spot clean; all of it has turned white — it is clean.
13:14	And on the day [(There is a "day" when plague-spots are inspected and a "day" when they are not inspected. A groom is given all seven days of his festivity — him, his garments, and his house (not to be inspected). Likewise, one is granted all the days of a festival.)] that there appear in it healthy flesh [(If a limb tip, which could not be rendered unclean by the appearance of healthy flesh (which normally does render a plague-spot unclean) because the entire limb, by virtue of its "slopes" could not be viewed at one time — If such a limb tip broadened and leveled, so that it could be viewed at one time, and healthy flesh appeared in it, then)] he shall be unclean.
13:15	And the Cohein shall see the healthy flesh, and he shall declare him unclean. The healthy flesh is unclean; it is leprosy.
13:16	Or if the healthy flesh recede and it return to white, then he shall come to the Cohein.
13:17	And the Cohein shall view it, and, behold, the plague-spot has turned to white, then the Cohein shall declare the plague-spot clean; he is clean.
13:18	And flesh, if there be in it, in its skin, a boil [a warming of the flesh due to a wound], and it [the boil] be healed,
13:19	And there be in the place of the boil a white se'eth or a reddish-white bahereth, then it shall be shown to the Cohein.
13:20	And the Cohein shall see, and, behold, its appearance is lower than the skin, and its hair has turned white, then the Cohein shall declare him unclean. It is a plague-spot of leprosy; it has blossomed in the boil.
13:21	And if the Cohein see it, and, behold, there is no white hair in it, and it is not lower than the skin, and it is dim, then the Cohein shall quarantine him for seven days.
13:22	And if it spread in the skin, then the Cohein shall declare him unclean; it [the se'eth or the bahereth] is plague.
13:23	And if the bahereth remains in its place — if it has not spread — then it is the scar of the boil, and the Cohein shall declare him clean.
13:24	Or flesh, if there be in its skin a burn by fire, and the healing of the burn were [i.e., turned into] a bahereth, reddish-white or [plain] white [(Note: There is no difference between the (accompanying) signs of a boil and a burn. Scripture treats boil and burn separately by way of indicating that half-minimum sizes of each do not combine to render one unclean.)]
13:25	Then the Cohein shall see it, and, behold, if the hair has turned white in the bahereth, and its appearance is deeper than the skin, it is leprosy; it has blossomed in the burn. And the Cohein shall declare him unclean; it is a plague-spot of leprosy.
13:26	And if the Cohein see it, and, behold, there is not in the bahereth a white hair, and it is not lower than the skin, and it is dim, then the Cohein shall quarantine him for seven days.
13:27	And the Cohein shall see him on the seventh day. If it has spread in the skin, then the Cohein shall declare him unclean; it is a plague-spot of leprosy.
13:28	And if the bahereth remains in its place, not having spread in the skin, and it is dim, then it is the rising of the burn. And the Cohein shall declare him clean, for it is the scar of the burn.
13:29	And a man or a woman — if there be in him a plague-spot, in the head or in the beard [(Scripture comes to distinguish between a plague-spot in the hair (site) and one in the flesh, the former being characterized by yellow hair and the latter by white)],
13:30	Then the Cohein shall see the plague-spot; and if its appearance is deeper than the skin and there is in it thin yellow hair, [the black hair in it having turned to yellow], then the Cohein shall declare him unclean. It is a nethek (a scall); it is leprosy of the head or of the beard.
13:31	And if the Cohein see the nethek plague-spot, and, behold, its appearance is not deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the Cohein shall quarantine the nethek plague-spot for seven days [(But if there were black hair, he is clean and quarantine is not require, black hair being a sign of cleanliness in a nethek)].
13:32	And the Cohein shall see the plague-spot on the seventh day, and, behold, if the nethek has not spread, and there is no yellow hair in it [(but if it did spread or there were yellow hair, he is unclean)], and the appearance of the nethek is not deeper than the skin,
13:33	Then he shall be shaved [around the nethek], but the nethek he shall not shave. [(He leaves a border two hairs (thick) roundabout it, so that if it spreads, it will pass that border into the shaven area and be discernible (as having spread)]. And the Cohein shall quarantine the nethek a second seven days.
13:34	And the Cohein shall see the nethek on the seventh day. And, behold, if the nethek has not spread in the skin, and its appearance is not deeper than the skin, then the Cohein shall declare him clean, and he shall wash his clothes and he shall be clean.
13:35	And if the nethek has spread, spread in the skin after his cleaning [("spread, spread"): Not only after his quarantine, but also after the first week or after the second week)],
13:36	Then the Cohein shall see him, and, behold, the nethek has spread in the skin, then the Cohein shall not seek out the yellow hair; he is unclean.
13:37	And if in his eyes the nethek has remained as it was, and black hair [or hair of any color other than yellow] has sprouted in it, then the nethek has been healed; he is clean. And the Cohein shall declare him clean [(But if the Cohein declared clean one who is unclean, he does not become clean)].
13:38	And a man or a woman, if there be in the skin of their flesh white spots,
13:39	Then the Cohein shall see, and, behold, in the skin of their flesh there are dull white spots, it is a bohak (brightness) that has blossomed in the skin [(like the white that "shines out" between freckles)]; he is clean.
13:40	And a man, if the hair of his head [from the slope of his head towards the nape (karachath)] fall out, he is kereach (bald); he is clean [of nethek uncleanliness, (and subject only to flesh uncleanliness)].
13:41	And if from the front of his face [from the slope of his head towards the face, including the temples (gabachath)], his hair fall out, he is gibeach (bald); he is clean.
13:42	And if there be on the karachath or on the gabachath a reddish-white plague-spot, it is blossoming leprosy on his karachath or on his gabachath.
13:43	And the Cohein shall see him, and, behold, a rising of the plague-spot, reddish-white, is in his karachath or in his gabachath, as the appearance of the leprosy of the skin of the flesh, [all the laws of this type of leprosy applying here (as opposed to those of boil leprosy and burn leprosy)],
13:44	He is a leprous man; he is unclean. The Cohein shall declare him unclean, unclean [i.e., all lepers (and not only one with head-related leprosy) is included in what follows (45, etc.)]; in his head is his plague [viz., nethek leprosy].
13:45	And the leper in whom the plague-spot is found, his clothes shall be rent and his hair shall grow long, and the hair of his lips shall he cover, [like a mourner], and "Unclean! Unclean!" shall he cry, [so that people keep away from him].
13:46	All the days that the plague-spot is in him he shall be unclean. He is unclean. Solitary shall he sit [Other unclean ones shall not sit with him. Because he, through his slander (for which leprosy is the punishment,) "separated" a husband from his wife and a man from his neighbor, he, too, shall be separated (from his fellow men)]; outside the camp [the three camps] is his dwelling.
13:47	And the garment, if there be in it a plague-spot of leprosy, in a garment of wool or in a garment of linen,
13:48	Or in the warp or in the woof, of linen or of wool, or in [unworked] skin or in all worked skin,
13:49	And it shall be, if the plague-spot is deep green or deep red in the garment or in the skin, or in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of skin, it is a plague-spot of leprosy, and it shall be shown to the Cohein.
13:50	And the Cohein shall see the plague-spot, and he shall quarantine the plague-spot for seven days.
13:51	And he shall see the plague-spot on the seventh day. If the plague-spot has spread in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, (whatever work the skin is made for), the plague-spot is "pricking" leprosy; it is unclean.
13:52	And he shall burn the garment, or the warp, or the woof, of wool or of linen, or any article of skin in which the plague-spot will be; for it is "pricking" leprosy — it shall be burned in fire.
13:53	And if the Cohein shall see, and, behold, the plague-spot has not spread in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any article of skin,
13:54	Then the Cohein shall command, and they shall wash what contains the plague-spot [i.e., the plague spot along with some of the surrounding material], and he shall quarantine it a second seven days.
13:55	And the Cohein shall see, after the plague-spot has been washed, and, behold, the plague-spot has not changed its appearance [i.e., it has not dimmed] and the plague-spot has not spread, it is unclean. [(It goes without saying that it is unclean if it did not change its appearance and did spread)]. In fire shall you burn it; it is p'cheteth [a "low-lying" plague-spot] in its oldness or in its newness.
13:56	And if the Cohein saw, and, behold, the plague-spot became dim after it was washed, then he shall tear it [the plague-spot site] from the garment, or from the skin, or from the warp, or from the woof, [and he shall burn it.]
13:57	And if it be seen again in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any article of skin, it is porachath [something whose "blossoming" recurs]. In fire shall you burn it [(the entire garment)], what contains the plague-spot.
13:58	And the garment, or the warp, or the woof, or any article of skin which you shall wash [by directive of the Cohein], and the plague-spot depart [entirely] from them, then it shall be cleansed [i.e., immersed] a second time, and it shall be clean.
13:59	This is the law of the plague-spot of leprosy, in a garment of wool or linen, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any article of skin, to declare it clean or to declare it unclean.

14:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
14:2	This shall be the law of the leper on the day of his cleansing [(whence it is derived that he is not cleansed at night)]; he shall be brought to the Cohein.
14:3	And the Cohein shall go outside the camp [(outside the three camps, where the leper was sent in the days of his confirmed leprosy)], and the Cohein shall see, and, behold, if the plague-spot of leprosy is healed from the leper,
14:4	Then the Cohein shall command that there be taken for the one to be cleansed two clean, living [(excluding treifah)] birds. ([Leprosy, coming upon one because of slander, birds ("chirpers") are brought)], and cedar-wood [(leprosy coming upon one (also) because of pride)], and [a tongue of] wool (dyed) scarlet (sh'ni tola'ath), and hyssop. [What is his "remedy"? Let him "lower" himself, like a worm (tola'ath) and like hyssop.]
14:5	And the Cohein shall command and he shall slaughter one bird into an earthen vessel over living water [He places the water (a quarter of a log) in the vessel first so that the blood of the bird be discernible in it.]
14:6	The living bird, he shall take it [by itself] and the cedar-wood, and the scarlet wool, and the hyssop [(all three bound together)], and he shall dip them and the living bird [together] in the blood of the slaughtered bird over the living water.
14:7	And he shall sprinkle upon the one to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and he shall cleanse him, and he shall send the living bird over the face of the field.
14:8	And the one to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and he shall shave all of his hair, and he shall bathe in water, and he shall be clean; and he shall come into the camp. And he shall sit outside his tent [(i.e., he shall abstain from marital relations)] for seven days.
14:9	And it shall be on the seventh day that he shall shave all of his hair. His head, his beard, and the brows of his eyes — all of his [visible, "gathered"] hair shall he shave. And he shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.
14:10	And on the eighth day he shall take two he-lambs without blemish, and one ewe-lamb of the first year, without blemish [for a sin-offering], and three tenth parts of (an ephah of) fine flour for a meal-offering, mixed with oil, [for the libations of these three lambs], and one log of oil [for the seven sprinklings and the applications on ear and thumbs].
14:11	And the Cohein that cleanses shall stand the man who is to be cleansed and those (things) before the L rd [(at the gate of Nikanor, not in the azarah itself, for he lacks atonement)], at the door of the tent of meeting.
14:12	And the Cohein shall take one of the he-lambs, and he shall bring it near [into the azarah] as a guilt-offering [to be waved (live)], and the log of oil, and he shall wave them [the guilt-offering and the log] before the L rd.
14:13	And he shall slaughter the lamb in the place where he slaughters the sin-offering and the burnt-offering [(on the side of the altar in the north)], in the holy place. For as the sin-offering [i.e., as all sin-offerings], the guilt-offering [i.e., this guilt-offering] is the Cohein's [i.e., it is subject to all of the Cohein's services for a sin-offering. But (unlike a sin-offering, its blood is not applied on the altar above (but it is dashed roundabout the altar below, for)] it is holy of holies. [see 7:2].
14:14	And the Cohein shall take from the blood of the guilt-offering, and the Cohein shall place it on the tnuch [the middle wall] of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
14:15	And the Cohein shall take from the log of oil, and he shall pour onto the Cohein's left palm.
14:16	And the Cohein shall dip his right finger from the oil on his left palm, and he shall sprinkle from the oil with his finger seven times before the L rd [i.e., opposite the holy of holies].
14:17	And from the rest of the oil which is on his palm, the Cohein shall place on the tnuch of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the guilt-offering.
14:18	And what is left over of the oil which is on the palm of the Cohein, he shall place on the head of the one who is to be cleansed, and the Cohein shall atone for him before the L rd.
14:19	And the Cohein shall offer up the sin-offering, and he shall atone for the one to be cleansed from his uncleanliness, and then he shall slaughter the burnt-offering.
14:20	And the Cohein shall offer up on the altar the burnt-offering and the [libation] meal-offering [which accompanies an animal sacrifice], and the Cohein shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean.
14:21	And if he is poor and his means do not suffice, then he shall take one he-lamb as a guilt-offering to be waved to make atonement for him, and one tenth-part of fine flour mixed with oil as a meal-offering, and a log of oil [for application on the thumbs].
14:22	And two turtle-doves or two young pigeons, such as his means suffice for; and one shall be a sin-offering, and the other, a burnt-offering.
14:23	And he shall bring them to the Cohein on the eighth day of his cleansing [i.e., the eighth day after the bringing of the birds and the sprinkling from the (dipping of the) cedar-wood, the hyssop, and the scarlet] to the door of the tent of meeting before the L rd.
14:24	And the Cohein shall take the lamb of the guilt-offering, and the log of oil, and the Cohein shall wave them, a wave-offering before the L rd.
14:25	And he shall slaughter the lamb of the guilt-offering, and the Cohein shall take from the blood of the guilt-offering and place it on the tnuch of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
14:26	And of the oil, the Cohein shall pour onto the Cohein's left palm.
14:27	And the Cohein shall sprinkle with his right finger from the oil that is on his left palm, seven times before the L rd.
14:28	And the Cohein shall place from the oil that is on his palm upon the tnuch of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the guilt-offering [(even if the blood has been wiped off, the "place" being the crucial factor)].
14:29	And what is left over of the oil which is on the palm of the Cohein, he shall place on the head of the one to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before the L rd.
14:30	And he shall offer one of the turtle-doves or of the young pigeons, from what his means suffice for.
14:31	What his means suffice for, one for a sin-offering; the other, for a burnt-offering, with the meal-offering. And the Cohein shall make atonement for the one to be cleansed before the L rd.
14:32	This is the law for him with a plague-spot of leprosy whose means do not suffice in his cleansing.
14:33	And the L rd spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying:
14:34	When you come to the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put a plague-spot of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession [(a "glad tiding." All forty years that Israel was in the desert the Amorites stored treasure in the walls of their houses. The L rd here apprises them that He will send plague upon these houses. When they raze the house (as per the halachah) they will find it.)] —
14:35	Then he whose house it is shall come, and he shall tell the Cohein, saying: As a plague-spot [(Even if he is a sage, and knows it to be a plague-spot, he should say only "As a plague spot")] there has appeared to me in the house.
14:36	And the Cohein shall command, and they shall empty out the house before the Cohein comes in to see the plague-spot, so that there not be made unclean all that is in the house [(Scripture being solicitous even of earthen vessels, which if unclean, cannot be cleansed in a mikveh (but must be broken)]; and then the Cohein shall come to see the house.
14:37	And he shall see the plague-spot, and, behold, if the plague-spot is in the walls of the house, embedded, deep green or deep red, and their appearance is lower than the (level of the) wall,
14:38	Then the Cohein shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and he shall shut up the house for seven days.
14:39	And the Cohein shall return on the seventh day and he shall see: If the plague-spot is spread in the walls of the house,
14:40	Then the Cohein shall command, and they shall remove the stones containing the plague-spot, and they shall cast them outside the city into an unclean place [i.e., a place not used for (ritually) clean things (Scripture apprising us that these stones render their place unclean while they are in it)].
14:41	And the house he shall scrape from inside roundabout [the plague-spot (i.e., he shall scrape the plaster around the plague-spot stones)], and they shall spill the mortar scrapings outside the city into an unclean place.
14:42	And they shall take other stones, and they shall bring them in place of the stones; and he shall take other mortar and plaster the house.
14:43	And if the plague-spot returns and blossoms in the house [at the end of a week] after he removed the stones and after the house has been scraped and after it has been plastered, [This verse continues (45): "Then he shall break down the house," until (47): "and he shall wash his clothes."]
14:44	[This verse is to be understood as following (verse 47)] And if the Cohein shall come and see [at the end of the second week (if it remained the same at the end of the first week)] and, behold, the plague-spot has spread in the house, it is "pricking" leprosy in the house; it is unclean [and he "removes, scrapes, plasters" and shuts it up another week. If it returns, he razes it; if it does not return, it requires birds (for cleansing — see 49). Verse 48 is to be understood as following at this point.]
14:45	[See 43] Then he shall break down the house — its stones, its wood, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall take them outside the city to an unclean place.
14:46	And he who comes into the house all the days [(in a "confirmed" house, even after scraping)] that he has shut it up [(but not while it is undergoing scraping)] shall be unclean until the evening. [The clothes of one who merely "enters," however, are not rendered unclean.]
14:47	And he who lies in the house shall wash his clothes, and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes [i.e., one who remains in the house the amount of time it takes to eat a p'ras (a half-loaf) shall wash his clothes].
14:48	[See 44] And if the Cohein comes [at the end of the second week], and he sees, and, behold, the plague-spot has not spread in the house, [he removes, scrapes, and plasters], and after plastering the house, the Cohein shall declare the house clean [if the plague-spot has not reappeared at the end of the week], for the plague spot has been healed.
14:49	And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar-wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.
14:50	And he shall slaughter one bird into a vessel over living water.
14:51	And he shall take the cedar-wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and he shall dip them in the blood of the slaughtered bird and in the living water, and he shall sprinkle upon the house seven times.
14:52	And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird and with the living water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar-wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet.
14:53	And he shall send the living bird outside the city over the face of the field, and he shall make atonement for the house, and it shall be clean.
14:54	This is the law for all plague-spots of leprosy and for a nethek.
14:55	And for the leprosy of a garment and of a house.
14:56	And for a se'eth and for a sapachath and for a bahereth.
14:57	To teach concerning the day it is declared unclean and the day it is declared clean. This is the law of leprosy.
15
15:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying:
15:2	Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: A man, if there be a flux (zov) from his flesh, [a genital discharge differing from semen in that semen is viscid, like the white of an egg, whereas zov is like barley-dough water, resembling the white of an addled egg], his flux is unclean.
15:3	And this shall be his uncleanliness in his flux. Whether his flesh [i.e., his orifice] drip his zov, [the flux issuing clear], or his flesh be stopped up with his zov, [the flux issuing thick], it is his uncleanliness.
15:4	Every bed on which the zav lies down [i.e., a bed which is made for "lying" and not for any other function] shall be unclean, and every object which he sits upon [i.e., an object which is made for "sitting"] shall be unclean.
15:5	And a man who touches what he (a zav) lay upon shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, [(the uncleanliness of what he lies upon (mishkav) being more stringent than the uncleanliness of what he touches, the first rendering a man unclean, who, in turn, renders his garments unclean; the second, rendering only food and drink unclean], and he shall be unclean until the evening.
15:6	And one who sits upon an object which the zav sat upon, [even if ten objects intervened (The same applies to mishkav)] shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and he shall be unclean until the evening.
15:7	And one who touches the flesh of the zav shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and he shall be unclean until the evening.
15:8	And if the zav spit upon one who is clean, [and the spittle touched him or he carried it], he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and he shall be unclean until the evening.
15:9	And every saddle upon which a zav rides, [even a part of the saddle on which he does not sit] shall be unclean.
15:10	And whoever touches anything that was beneath him [the zav] shall be unclean until the evening [Scripture here apprises us that one who touches the saddle of a zav does not render his clothing unclean (as opposed to one who touches his mishkav)]; and one who carries them [(his zov, his spittle, his semen, his urine, his mishkav, or his saddle)] shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and he shall be unclean until the evening.
15:11	And whoever the zav touches, if he (the zav) did not wash his hands [i.e., all of his visible body areas] with water [i.e., so long as he did not immerse, even after the flux ceased and he counted seven days] ("whoever the zav touches") shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and he shall be unclean until the evening.
15:12	And an earthen vessel which a zav touches [or moves without touching (heset)] shall be broken, and every wooden vessel shall be rinsed in water.
15:13	And when the zav is cleansed of his flux [i.e., when his flux ceases], then he shall count for himself seven [consecutive] days for his cleansing [i.e., not experiencing a flux], and he shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in running water, and he shall be clean.
15:14	And on the eighth day, he shall take for himself two turtle-doves or two young pigeons, and he shall come before the L rd to the door of the tent of meeting, and he shall give them to the Cohein.
15:15	And the Cohein shall offer them up, one as a sin-offering and the other as a burnt-offering; and the Cohein shall make atonement for him before the L rd from his flux.
15:16	And a man, if there issue from him semen, then he shall bathe all of his flesh in water and he shall be unclean until the evening.
15:17	And every garment and all skin upon which there shall be semen shall be washed in water and it shall be unclean until the evening.
15:18	And a woman, if a man lie with her a lying of semen, then they shall bathe in water and they shall be unclean until the evening [(the woman being unclean by "the King's decree" (her semen contact being internal)].
15:19	And a woman, if she has a flow, if blood shall be her flow in her flesh, seven days shall she be in her niddah [contact-forbidden] state [(even if she had only one "sighting")], and whoever touches her shall be unclean until the evening.
15:20	And all that she lies upon in her niddah state shall be unclean, and all that she sits upon shall be unclean.
15:21	And whoever touches what she lies upon shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and he shall be unclean until the evening.
15:22	And whoever touches any object that she sits upon shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and he shall be unclean until the evening.
15:23	And if [he lies or sits] on the (i.e., her) bed [or on her seat, even without directly touching it,] he, [too, requires washing of clothes]. Or, [if he sits] upon an object [including a saddle] that she sits upon — When he touches it [the saddle], he shall be unclean until the evening [but he need not wash his clothes].
15:24	And if a man lie with her, then her niddah state shall be upon him [(Just as she renders men and earthenware vessels unclean, so does he)], and he shall be unclean seven days [(even though he may have lived with her only in the middle of her (seven-day) niddah state)], and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean.
15:25	And a woman, if the flow of her blood flows many [i.e., three] days, not in the time of her [seven-day] niddah state, [but right after those days], or if she flows [these three days] above her niddah state [i.e., with one day intervening between the new flow and her (preceding) niddah state], then [she is a zavah, and] all the days of the flow of her uncleanliness, as the days of her niddah state shall she be; she is unclean.
15:26	Every bed that she lies upon all the days of her [zavah] flow, as the bed of her niddah state shall be to her; and every object that she sits upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanliness of her niddah state.
15:27	And whoever touches them shall be unclean. And he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and he shall be unclean until the evening.
15:28	And if she is cleansed of her flow, then she shall count for herself seven days, and then she shall be clean.
15:29	And on the eighth day, she shall take for herself two turtle-doves or two young pigeons, and she shall bring them to the Cohein, to the door of the tent of meeting.
15:30	And the Cohein shall offer up one as a sin-offering and the other as a burnt-offering, and the Cohein shall make atonement for her before the L rd from the flow of her uncleanliness.
15:31	And you shall separate the children of Israel from their uncleanliness, that they not die in their uncleanliness by defiling My sanctuary which is in their midst [(whence it is derived that the kareth ("cutting off") for defiling the sanctuary is called "death")].
15:32	This is the law of the zav [of only one "sighting"] and of one [i.e., he is like one] from whom semen issues forth to be made unclean thereby [i.e., he is unclean until the evening].
15:33	And ("this is the law") of her who flows in her niddah state, and of him who flows his flux [(two or three "sightings")], for male or female, and for a man who lies with a woman who is unclean.

16:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron when they drew near before the L rd and they died [(their death serving as "reinforcement" for the injunction that follows)]:
16:2	And the L rd said to Moses: Speak to Aaron your brother, and let him not come at all times to the holy place within the parocheth before the kaporeth which is on the ark that he not die [(If he comes he will die)]; for with the cloud I [always] appear on the kaporeth [(And since My shechinah manifests itself there, let him take care not to come there indiscriminately)].
16:3	With this, [(and only on Yom Kippur (29)] shall Aaron come to the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin-offering and a ram for a burnt-offering.
16:4	[The high-priest does not minister within, wearing the eight garments in which he normally officiates (for the latter have gold — and "the accuser" (the golden calf) cannot be the defender (on Yom Kippur), but he wears the four linen garments of the ordinary Cohein.] A linen kethoneth of kodesh [i.e., purchased with Temple funds] shall he wear, and linen michnasayim shall there be on his flesh, and with a linen avnet shall he gird himself, and a linen mitznefeth shall he place on his head; they are garments of kodesh. And he shall bathe his flesh in water and put them on. [He required five immersions and ablutions of hands and feet on that day for five changings (between inner and outer services)].
16:5	And from the congregation of the children of Israel, he shall take two he-goats for a sin-offering and one ram for a burnt-offering.
16:6	And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is his [(It must come from his own funds and not from community funds)], and he shall make atonement for himself and for his household [(He confesses over it his sins and those of his household)].
16:7	And he shall take the two he-goats and he shall stand them before the L rd at the door of the tent of meeting.
16:8	And Aaron shall place lots upon the two he-goats, one lot for the L rd, and the other lot for Azazel [a flinty crag (from which the goat was precipitated). He would place the goats on either side of him and from an urn draw lots, on one of which was written "for the L rd"; on the other, "for Azazel")]
16:9	And Aaron shall present the he-goat on which the lot came up for the L rd, and he shall make it a sin-offering [(When he places the lot upon it he says: "For the L rd, a sin-offering.")]
16:10	And the he-goat on which the lot came up for Azazel shall be stood living before the L rd [(whence it is derived that it is sent away for death)] to make atonement over it [i.e., to confess, viz. 21] to send it to Azazel to the desert.
16:11	And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering which is his, and he shall make atonement over it for himself and for his household [(a second confession for himself and for his fellow Cohanim to atone for defiling of the sanctuary and of its holy objects, viz. 16)], and he shall slaughter the bullock of the sin-offering which is his.
16:12	And he shall take a full coal-pan of coals of fire from off the [outer] altar before the L rd [i.e., from the side which faces the door (of the mishkan), the west], and his full handfuls of incense of spices ground [especially] small, and he shall bring them within the parocheth.
16:13	And he shall put the incense upon the fire [in the coal-pan] before the L rd and the cloud of incense shall cover the kaporeth which is on the testimony, and he shall not die [(but, being remiss in this service, he is liable to death)].
16:14	And he shall take the blood of the bullock, and he shall sprinkle with his finger [one sprinkling] on the kaporeth, on the east, and before the kaporeth shall he sprinkle seven times of the blood with his finger. [Hence, "one above and seven below"].
16:15	And he shall slaughter the he-goat of the sin-offering which is the people's [(What the bullock atones for for the Cohanim, the he-goat "for the L rd" atones for, for Israel)], and he shall bring its blood inside the parocheth. And he shall do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bullock [i.e., "one above and seven below"]; he shall sprinkle it on the kaporeth and before the kaporeth.
16:16	And he shall make atonement for the holy place from the uncleanlinesses of the children of Israel [for entering the sanctuary in a state of uncleanliness] and for their offenses [(willful entry in a state of uncleanliness)] for all of their transgressions [(unwitting entry in a state of uncleanliness without subsequent knowledge thereof)]. And so shall he do for the tent of meeting [(Just as he sprinkles of both within, one above and seven below, so he sprinkles of both on the parocheth outside, one above and seven below)], who dwells with them in the midst of their uncleanlinesses [(Though they be unclean, the Shechinah is with them)]
16:17	And no man shall be in the tent of meeting when he comes to make atonement in the holy place until he goes out. And he shall make atonement for himself, and for his household, and for the entire congregation of Israel.
16:18	And he shall go out to the [golden] altar which is before the L rd [after having stood inwards of the altar to sprinkle on the parocheth], and he shall make atonement on it — he shall take from the blood of the bullock and from the blood of the he-goat [intermixed] and he shall place it on the horns of the altar roundabout [beginning with the northeast corner].
16:19	And he shall sprinkle upon it [on its top] with his finger seven times, and he shall cleanse it [from past uncleanlinesses], and he shall hallow it [for the future] from the uncleanlinesses of the children of Israel.
16:20	And when he has finished making atonement for the holy place, and the tent of meeting, and the altar, then he shall draw near the living he-goat.
16:21	And Aaron shall place his two hands on the head of the living he-goat, and he shall confess over it all the transgressions of the children of Israel, and all their offenses of all their sins, and he shall place them on the head of the he-goat, and he shall send it by the hand of a readied man [readied from the day before] to the desert.
16:22	And the he-goat shall bear upon itself all of their transgressions to an uninhabited land, and he shall send out the he-goat in the desert. [Verse 24 is understood as following at this point.]
16:23	[This verse is understood as following after verse 28.] And Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting [to take out from the holy of holies the spoon and the coal pan in which he offered the incense], and he shall take off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the holy place, and he shall leave them there [(They require genizah (secreting) and are not used on another Yom Kippur.) And then he dons the golden garments for the daily afternoon burnt-offering. (Now, verse 29)]
16:24	[This verse is understood as following verse 22.] And he shall bathe his flesh in water in a holy place [(sanctified with the sanctity of the azarah. It, and the other four Yom Kippur immersions were on the roof of the beth haparvah. The first (daily immersion) was in an unsanctified area.)] And he shall put on his [eight regular] garments, and he shall go out [from the sanctuary to the court, where the burnt-offering altar was situated], and he shall offer up his burnt-offering [(3)] and the burnt-offering of the people [(5)], and he shall make atonement for himself and for the people.
16:25	And the fat of the sin-offering [the eimurim of the bullock and the goat] he shall smoke on the [outer] altar.
16:26	And he who sends the he-goat to Azazel shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, and then he may come to the camp.
16:27	And the bullock of the sin-offering and the goat of the sin-offering, whose blood was brought [into the sanctuary and into the holy of holies] to make atonement in the holy place, he shall take outside the camp, and they shall burn in fire their skin, and their flesh, and their dung.
16:28	And he who burns them shall wash his clothes and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and then he shall come to the camp. [Verse 23 is understood as following at this point.]
16:29	[After verse 23] And it shall be to you an everlasting statute: In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls. And all work you shall not do, the citizen and the stranger that sojourns in your midst.
16:30	For on this day He shall atone for you to cleanse you of all of your sins; before the L rd shall you be clean.
16:31	It is a Sabbath of Sabbaths to you, and you shall afflict your soul; it is an everlasting statute.
16:32	And the Cohein [(i.e., not only Aaron)] shall make atonement, who shall be anointed, and [(even if he is not anointed, as with the high-priests from Yoshiyahu on, after the anointing oil had been secreted)], who shall be invested [with the vestments of the high priest] to minister [if he is qualified] in place of his father; and he shall put on the linen garments, the holy garments.
16:33	And he shall make atonement for the sanctity of the holy place. And for the tent of meeting and for the altar shall he make atonement. And for the Cohanim and for all the people of the congregation shall he make atonement.
16:34	And this shall be to you for an everlasting statute to atone for the children of Israel from all of their sins once in the year. And he [Aaron] did [when Yom Kippur arrived] as the L rd commanded Moses, [and not for personal aggrandizement].
17
17:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
17:2	Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the children of Israel and say to them: This is the thing that the L rd commanded, saying:
17:3	A man from the house of Israel who slaughters [(consecrated animals)] an ox or a lamb, or a goat, in the camp [outside of the azarah] or who slaughters outside the camp,
17:4	And to the door of the tent of meeting he did not bring it to present it as an offering to the L rd before the mishkan of the L rd — blood shall it be reckoned to that man, [as if he had shed a man's blood (in which instance he is liable to death)]; he has spilled blood [(to include as thus liable one who sprinkles the blood outside)], and that man will be cut off from his people.
17:5	So that the children of Israel bring their sacrifices, which they are wont to slaughter in the open field, and bring them to the L rd, to the door of the tent of meeting, to the Cohein, and slaughter them as peace-offerings to the L rd.
17:6	And the Cohein shall dash the blood on the altar of the L rd at the door of the tent of meeting, and he shall smoke the fat, a sweet savor to the L rd.
17:7	And they shall sacrifice no more their sacrifices to the satyrs [demons], after which they go astray. An everlasting statute shall this be to them throughout their generations.
17:8	And to them shall you say: A man from the house of Israel, and from the stranger that dwells in their midst, who shall offer up a burnt-offering or a sacrifice [(to include for liability one who smokes the limbs outside just as one who slaughters outside)]
17:9	and not bring it to the door of the tent of meeting to offer it to the L rd, that man shall be cut off from his people [(His seed shall be cut off and his days shall be cut off)].
17:10	And a man from the house of Israel and from the stranger that dwells in their midst that shall eat any blood [(not only that of kodshim)] — I shall direct My regard to that soul which eats the blood, and I shall cut it off from the midst of its people.
17:11	For the life of [all] flesh is in the blood, wherefore I have given it to you upon the altar to atone for your lives; for it is the blood which atones for the life ["A life (the animal's) for a life"].
17:12	Therefore, I have said to the children of Israel: All souls of you [(the elders being exhorted over the children)] shall not eat blood; and the stranger that sojourns in your midst shall not eat blood.
17:13	And a man of the children of Israel and of the stranger that dwells in their midst, that shall hunt a hunting [(even if not actually "hunted")] of animal or bird that may be eaten [(unclean animals are excluded from what follows)], he shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth.
17:14	For the life of all flesh — its blood is in [place of] its life [i.e., its life is dependent upon its blood]. And I have said to the children of Israel: The blood of all flesh you shall not eat; for the life of all flesh is its blood; whoever eats it shall be cut off.
17:15	And every soul that eats neveilah (carcass) or treifah (what is "torn") [(Scripture speaks here of the neveilah of a clean fowl)], whether citizen or stranger, he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and he shall be unclean until the evening, and then he shall be clean.
17:16	And if he does not wash (his clothes) and he does not bathe his flesh [and he eats kodshim or enters the sanctuary], he shall bear his sin [(kareth for not bathing his body; stripes for not washing his clothes)].
18
18:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
18:2	Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: I am the L rd your G d [I am He who said in Sinai: "I am the L rd your G d," and you accepted My kingdom upon you; now accept My decrees.]
18:3	As the deeds of the land of Egypt in which you dwelt you shall not do; and as the deeds of the land of Canaan, [(the Egyptians and Canaanites being the most corrupt of the peoples, and the place where Israel dwelt being the most corrupt of all)], to which I bring you [(those peoples conquered by Israel being the most corrupt of all)], you shall not do, and in their statutes [(i.e., in their customs, things which have become like "statutes" for them, like frequenting theaters and stadia)], you shall not walk.
18:4	My judgments shall you do [("judgments"): "just" things, which, even if they had not been stated, would have warranted observance)], and My statutes shall you keep to walk in them [("statutes"): decrees of the King, "questioned" by the evil inclination and by the nations of the world, such as (the interdictions against) the eating of pig and the wearing of sha'atnez (a mixture of wool and linen), and the purification effected by the waters of the red heifer. ("to walk in them"): Do not exempt yourself from them by saying: "I have learned the wisdom of Israel; I shall now go and learn the wisdom of the nations"]; I am the L rd your G d [My decree is upon you and you are not at liberty to exempt yourself from it.]
18:5	And you shall keep My statutes and My judgments [(including what may be deduced, though not explicitly stated)], which a man shall do, and he shall live by them [in the world to come]; I am the L rd [trusted to reward].
18:6	A man, to all the kin of his flesh shall not draw near [(lo tikrevu, plural, women being exhorted as well as men)] to uncover nakedness (i.e., to cohabit); I am the L rd [trusted to reward].
18:7	The nakedness of your father [i.e., your father's wife] and the nakedness of your mother, [though she not be your father's wife], you shall not reveal. She is your mother; you shall not reveal her nakedness.
18:8	The nakedness of the wife of your father, [even after his death], you shall not reveal; it is your father's nakedness.
18:9	The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father, [even by a woman that he ravished], or the daughter of your mother, whether she be born [of a woman that he is permitted to keep] at home [as a wife], or born [of a woman that he is commanded to send] outside [such as a mamzereth or a nethinah] — you shall not uncover their nakedness.
18:10	The nakedness of the daughter of your son [(even) by a woman that you ravished] or the daughter of your daughter [(even)] by a woman that you ravished], you shall not reveal their nakedness; for they are your nakedness.
18:11	The nakedness of the daughter of your father's wife, [one fit to be a "wife," not a bondswoman or a gentile], begotten of your father — she is your sister; you shall not reveal her nakedness.
18:12	The nakedness of the sister of your father you shall not reveal; she is the kin of your father.
18:13	The nakedness of the sister of your mother you shall not reveal; for she is the kin of your mother.
18:14	The nakedness of the brother of your father you shall not reveal; to his wife do not come near; she is your aunt.
18:15	The nakedness of your daughter-in-law you shall not reveal. She is the wife of your son [("wife"): to exclude one he has ravished, a bondswoman, or a gentile]; you shall not reveal her nakedness.
18:16	The nakedness of the wife of your brother you shall not reveal; it is the nakedness of your brother.
18:17	The nakedness of a [(halachically) married] woman and her daughter you shall not uncover [(But one is permitted to marry the daughter of a woman he ravished)]. The daughter of her son and the daughter of her daughter you shall not take to reveal her nakedness. They are kin; it is scheming.
18:18	And a woman together with her sister you shall not take, to be rivals [i.e., to make one a rival to the other], to reveal her nakedness upon her in her lifetime [(If he divorced her, he may not marry her sister as long as she is alive.)]
18:19	And to a woman in the niddah state of her uncleanliness, you shall not come near to reveal her nakedness.
18:20	And to the wife of your neighbor do not give your lying for seed to become unclean to her.
18:21	And from your seed you shall not give [to the priests of Molech (a kind of idolatry)] to pass [between two large pyres] to Molech. And you shall not desecrate the name of your G d; I am the L rd.
18:22	And with a male you shall not lie the lyings of a woman; it is an abomination.
18:23	And with every beast do not give your lying to become unclean with it. And a woman shall not stand before a beast to mount her; it is dissolute.
18:24	You shall not become unclean with all of these. For with all of these the nations became unclean, which I am sending away before you.
18:25	And the land became unclean, and I visited its sin upon it, and the land vomited out its inhabitants.
18:26	And you shall keep My statutes and My judgments, and you shall not do any of these abominations, the citizen and the stranger that sojourns among you.
18:27	For all of these abominations were done by the people of the land which were before you, and the land became unclean.
18:28	So that the land not vomit you out by your making it unclean, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.
18:29	For all who do any of these abominations, the souls [(male and female are implied)] that do so shall be cut off from the midst of their people.
18:30	And you shall keep My keeping [(beth-din being exhorted thereto)], not to do in the manner of the abominations that were done before you, and you shall not become unclean in them; I am the L rd your G d [(But if you defile yourselves, then I am not your G d, and how do you then avail Me?)]
Kedoshim
19
19:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
19:2	Speak to the entire congregation of the children of Israel, [(This section was stated in the presence of all, for most of the major tenets of Torah are inherent in it.)] and say to them: Holy shall you be. [Separate yourselves from illicit relations], for holy am I, the L rd your G d.
19:3	A man, his mother and his father shall you fear, [("mother" is stated before "father" because a man normally fears his father more than he does his mother)], and My Sabbaths shall you keep [(If parents bid their children to transgress mitzvoth, they are not to be heeded)]: I am the L rd your G d [(Both you and your parents are obliged to honor Me.)] [What is "fear"? Not sitting in his place, not speaking in his stead, not contradicting his words.]
19:4	Do not turn to the elilim [(lit., "non-entities") to serve them], and molten gods [(If you turn to them, you will make them gods)] do not make for yourselves [(neither you for others nor others for you)]; I am the L rd your G d.
19:5	And when you slaughter a sacrifice of peace-offerings to the L rd — so that you find favor [with it in the eyes of the L rd] shall you slaughter it.
19:6	[i.e., Slaughter it with the intent that] it will be eaten on the day that you sacrifice it and on the morrow, and (that) what remains of it [nothar] on the third day will be burned with fire [as indicated in 7:16-17].
19:7	And if it is eaten on the third day [(exegetically, if it is eaten outside of its prescribed place)], it is piggul ["abhorrent"]; it shall not be accepted.
19:8	And the eater of it [absolute nothar] shall bear his sin, for he has profaned the holy thing of the L rd; and that soul shall be cut off from its people.
19:9	And when you cut the harvest of your land, do not end off the corner (peah) of your field to cut it; and the gleaning (leket) of your harvest, [one or two ears (but not more) which fall to the ground during reaping] you shall not gather.
19:10	And your vineyard you shall not glean [You shall not take the oleiloth (tendrils which have no grapes bunched together or hanging down from the end)]; and the fallen fruit (peret) of your vineyard [single grapes which fall to the ground at the time of reaping] you shall not gather. To the poor man and to the stranger you shall leave them; I am the L rd your G d [a Judge, exacting punishment (of those who steal from the poor)].
19:11	You shall not steal [(an exhortation against stealing money)], and you shall not deny [(an exhortation towards the payment of the principal and the fifth in an instance of denial (5:22)], and you shall not lie one to another [(an exhortation towards the payment of the principal and the fifth in an instance of swearing falsely). If you steal, you will come to deny, to lie, and to swear falsely.)]
19:12	And you shall not swear in My name [(even by an epithet)] falsely and (thereby) profane the name of your G d; I am the L rd.
19:13	You shall not oppress your neighbor [(This alludes to holding back the wages of a hired worker)], and you shall not rob. There shall  not abide with you the wages of a [day] laborer until [the next] morning.
19:14	You shall not curse the deaf man [(i.e., any man who is alive)], and before the blind man [i.e., one who is "blind" in a certain matter], do not place a stumbling-block. And you shall fear your G d, [who knows your intentions]; I am the L rd.
19:15	You shall not do wrong in judgment [(A judge who perverts justice is called "wrong," "hated," "revolting," "rejected," "abominable")]. You shall not lift up the face of the poor man [Do not say: He is poor and the rich man is obliged to sustain him; I shall vindicate him in judgment so that he can support himself honorably.], and you shall not favor the face of the great one [Do not say: He is a wealthy man, the son of great ones; how can I shame him and look on at his shame!] In righteousness shall you judge your neighbor.
19:16	You shall not go spying out among your people [with an eye to slandering]. You shall not stand by the blood of your neighbor, [watching him die, when you can help him]; I am the L rd, [trusted to reward and trusted to exact punishment].
19:17	You shall not hate your brother in your heart. Reprove shall you reprove your neighbor, but do not bear sin because of him [(Do not shame him in public)].
19:18	You shall not take revenge [e.g., "You did not lend me; I will not lend you!"], and you shall not bear a grudge against the children of your people [e.g.. "I am not like you who did not lend me; I shall lend you!"]. And you shall love your neighbor as yourself. [(R. Akiva said: This is an all-embracing principle in Torah)]; I am the L rd.
19:19	My statutes (chukim), [which follow,] shall you keep [chukim are "decrees of the King," for which no reasons are given]: You shall not mate your beast with a diverse kind (kilayim); your field you shall not sow with diverse seeds (kilayim), and a mingled (kilayim, interwoven) garment (sha'atnez) shall not come upon you ["sha'atnez" — felt-stuff (of wool and linen) mingled. Acronymically, "shua" (hackled), "tavui" (spun), "nuz" (twined)].
19:20	And a man, if he lie with a woman, a lying of seed, and she be a [Canaanite] maidservant [half bondswoman-half freewoman]; bound [i.e., betrothed] to a man [a Hebrew bondsman], and she has not been redeemed [with money], or freedom has not been given to her [by writ], she shall be inquired after [towards her (but not his) receiving stripes]. They shall not be put to death, for she was not freed [(But if she had been freed, the betrothal is bona fide, and the death penalty obtains)].
19:21	And he (the man who lay with her) shall bring his guilt-offering to the L rd, to the door of the tent of meeting, a ram for a guilt-offering.
19:22	And the Cohein shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt-offering before the L rd for his sin which he has sinned, and it shall be forgiven him for his sin which he has sinned [(deliberate as well as unwitting)].
19:23	And when you come to the land and you plant every fruit tree, then you shall count its fruit as forbidden. Three years [beginning with the time of its planting] shall it be to you as forbidden [(Its fruit remains forbidden even if secreted until after three years)]; it shall not be eaten.
19:24	And in the fourth year, all of its fruit shall be holy for praise to the L rd [(like ma'aser sheini. Just as ma'aser sheini is not eaten outside the walls of Jerusalem unless redeemed, this too. And this is "praise to the L rd." He carries it there to praise the L rd.)]
19:25	And in the fifth year you may eat its fruit, to increase for you its produce [(Your observance of the mitzvah for four years will lead to an increase of productivity)]. I am the L rd your G d, [who assures you thus, and I am trusted to fulfill My assurance].
19:26	You shall not eat over the blood [(an exhortation against eating the flesh of kodshim before the sprinkling of the blood, an exhortation against eating (the flesh of) a non-consecrated beast before the life has gone out of it, etc.)]. You shall not practice divination, [in the manner of those who (attempt to) divine propitious times) from certain occurrences, viz.: "His bread fell from his mouth," "A deer crossed his path," etc.], and you shall not practice soothsaying (lo teoneinu) from onoth ("times"), e.g., "This day is auspicious for beginning work," etc.]
19:27	You shall not round off the corners of your head [("rounding off" is aligning the hair of one's temples with that behind his ears and that of his forehead)], and you shall not destroy the corners of your beard [the end of the beard and its borders].
19:28	And a cutting for a [dead] person you shall not make in your flesh, [as was the custom of the Emorites]; and writing that is engraved [in the skin so that it can never be removed] you shall not make upon yourselves — I am the L rd.
19:29	Do not profane your daughter to make her a harlot [(the allusion is to handing over one's unwedded daughter for intercourse not for the purpose of marriage)], lest the land fall into harlotry, [producing its fruits elsewhere, and not in your land], and the land be filled with lewdness.
19:30	My Sabbaths shall you keep, and My sanctuary shall you fear [(One may not enter the sanctuary with his staff, or his shoes, or with his money belt, or with the dust on his feet) — but the construction of the Temple does not override the Sabbath]; I am the L rd.
19:31	Do not turn to the ovoth [a ba'al ov is a wizard who speaks from his armpits], and to the yidonim [a yidoni is one who places the bone of an animal called "yidoa" in his mouth, and the bone speaks]. Do not seek [to occupy yourselves with them] to be defiled by them [i.e., If you occupy yourselves with them you defile yourselves before Me, and I will abominate you.] I am the L rd your G d [Know whom you are exchanging for whom.]
19:32	Before the hoary head you shall rise, and you shall honor the face of the elder, [(the "elder":) one who has acquired wisdom. (What is "honor"? One should not sit in his place or contradict his words)]. And you shall fear your G d [Do not close your eyes (to the hoary head and the elder) as if you did not see him — your G d knows your heart]; I am the L rd.
19:33	And if there dwell among you a stranger in your land, you shall not oppress him [(verbally viz.: "Yesterday you served idols, and today you come to study Torah, which issued from the mouth of the Almighty!")]
19:34	As the home-born among you shall he be to you, the stranger that lives among you. And you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt [("Do not impute your own blemish to your fellow-man")]; I am the L rd your G d ["your" (plural) — your G d and his].
19:35	You shall not do wrong in judgment [measurement (the measurer being a "judge" and being accountable as a judge)] — in land-measure, in weight, and in liquid measure.
19:36	Just balances, just stones [(against which things are weighed)], a just ephah [dry measure] and a just hin [liquid measure] shall you have. I am the L rd your G d who took you out of the land of Egypt [to this end].
19:37	And you shall heed all of My statutes and all of My judgments, and you shall do them; I am the L rd.
20
20:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
20:2	And to the children of Israel shall you say [(the punishments attaching to the exhortations)]: A man of the children of Israel and of the stranger who sojourns in Israel, who gives of his seed to the Molech shall be put to death [by beth-din, and if beth-din lack the power], the people of the land shall [assist them and] stone him with stones. [("the people of the land":) the people for whom the land was created, the people who are destined to inherit the land through these mitzvoth]
20:3	And I shall direct My regard to that man, and I will cut him off, [(but not an entire congregation who serve the Molech)] from the midst of his people, for of his seed [("of") including his grandson, etc.] he has given to the Molech to defile My holy ones [the congregation of Israel] and to profane My holy name.
20:4	And if the people of the land avert, avert their eyes from that man [(If they avert their eyes in one thing, they are destined to avert them in many things; if the lesser sanhedrin averts its eyes, the Great Sanhedrin is destined to avert its eyes)] when he gives of his seed to the Molech, not to put him to death,
20:5	Then I shall direct My regard to that man and to his family, [who "cover up" for him], and I will cut him off, [him with kareth; his family, with afflictions], and all who go astray after him to stray after the Molech [(Subsumed in this are other idols served in the manner of Molech though that not be their normal mode of worship)] (I will cut off) from the midst of their people.
20:6	And the soul that turns to the ovoth and to the yidonim to stray after them — I shall set My face against that soul, and I shall cut him off from the midst of his people.
20:7	And you shall sanctify yourselves [by separating from idolatry] and you shall be holy, for I am the L rd your G d.
20:8	And you shall heed My statutes and do them; I am the L rd who makes you holy.
20:9	For a man who curses his father and his mother shall be put to death. His father and his mother has he cursed [(He is liable even if he curses them after their death)]; his blood is in him [i.e., on his own head].
20:10	And a man, [and not a minor], who lives with the wife of a man, [and not with the wife of a minor], who lives with the wife of his neighbor, [and not with the wife of a gentile] — the adulterer and the adulteress shall be put to death [(by strangulation)].
20:11	And a man who lies with his father's wife, he has revealed the nakedness of his father. Both of them shall be put to death; their blood is in them.
20:12	And if a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall be put to death. They have wrought shamefully; their blood is in them.
20:13	And if a man lies with a male the lyings of a woman ["as the reed is inserted into the tube"], an abomination has been wrought by both of them. They shall be put to death; their blood is in them.
20:14	And if a man takes a woman [his mother-in-law] and her mother, it is lewdness. In fire shall they be burned, he and they, and there shall not be lewdness in your midst.
20:15	And if a man gives his lying to a beast, he shall be put to death, and the beast shall you kill [(because the man went astray through it)].
20:16	And if a woman draws close to any beast so that it mount her, you shall kill the woman and the beast. They shall be put to death; their blood is in them.
20:17	And if a man takes his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother, and sees her nakedness, and she sees his nakedness, it is shameful. And they shall be cut off before the eyes of the children of their people. The nakedness of his sister he has revealed; he shall bear his sin.
20:18	And if a man lies with a woman in her flow and reveals her nakedness — her fount has he bared [(peripheral intercourse is hereby connoted)], and she has revealed the fount of her blood, and both of them shall be cut off from the midst of their people.
20:19	And the nakedness of your mother's sister [whether from her father or her mother] or your father's sister [whether from his father or his mother], you shall not reveal. Because he has bared his (close) flesh, they shall bear their sin.
20:20	And a man who lies with the wife of his uncle [his father's brother from his father], the nakedness of his uncle has he revealed. They shall bear their sin; childless shall they die. [If they have children, they will die in their lifetimes. ("Cutting off," then, (kareth), in 18:29, refers to going childless)].
20:21	And if a man takes the wife of his brother, it [this cohabitation] is niddah ["rejected," "repulsive"], the nakedness of his brother has he revealed; childless shall they be [(i.e., remain) if they have no children.]
20:22	And you shall heed all of My statutes and all of My judgments, and you shall do them, so that the land not vomit you out, whither I bring you to dwell in it.
20:23	And you shall not walk in the statutes of the nation which I am sending away before you. For all of these (abominations) they did, and I despised them.
20:24	And I said to you: You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to inherit, a land flowing with milk and honey. I am the L rd your G d who separated you from the peoples.
20:25	And you shall separate between the clean beast and the unclean [i.e., between that which is clean for you and that which is unclean, between the severing of the majority of the shechitah sign (in which instance the animal is kasher) and the severing of half (in which instance it is treifah)], and between the unclean fowl and the clean; and you shall not make yourselves despicable through the beast or the fowl, or through anything with which the ground swarms, which I have separated for you as unclean [i.e., as forbidden].
20:26	And you shall be holy unto Me, for I, the L rd, am holy; and I have set you apart from the peoples to be Mine [If you are separate from them, you are Mine; if not, you are "Nevuchadnezzar's."]
20:27	And a man or a woman if there be in them an ov or yidoni, they shall be put to death. With stones shall they stone them; their blood is in them. [Where there are witnesses and warning — stoning; wittingness, without warning — kareth; unwittingness — a sin-offering. The same applies to all transgressions punishable by death where "kareth" is stated.]

21:1	And the L rd said to Moses: Speak to the Cohanim, [(excluding chalalim, those unfit to minister)], the sons of Aaron, [(even those with blemishes) (and not the daughters of Aaron)], and say to them [(adults being exhorted in respect to minors)]: For a dead body he (a Cohein) shall not become unclean among his people [i.e., when the dead one is "among his people," excluding a meth mitzvah (one who has no one else to bury him)].
21:2	Only for his flesh [his wife] that is near to him, his mother and his father, his son and his daughter and his brother.
21:3	And for his sister, the virgin, who is near to him [(including one who is betrothed)], who was not wed to a man [for cohabitation] — for her shall he make himself unclean.
21:4	A husband (who is a Cohein) shall not defile himself [for his wife when she is] in [the midst of] his people [i.e., when there are others to bury her (in which instance she is not a meth mitzvah). (And the wife spoken of here is one)] through whom he is profaned [(made a chalal) by living with her].
21:5	They shall not make a baldness upon their head [for one who dies], and the corner of their beard they shall not shave off [with a razor], and in their flesh they shall not make any cutting [(There is liability for each cutting.)]
21:6	Holy shall they be, [perforce. Beth-din compels them to remain holy (i.e., not to make themselves unclean)] to their G d, and they shall not profane the name of their G d; for the fire-offerings of the L rd, the bread of their G d, they offer up — and they shall be holy.
21:7	A woman who is a harlot or profaned (chalalah) [a woman born of those unfit for the priesthood, e.g., the daughter of a widow by a high-priest, or of a divorced woman by an ordinary priest, or a woman who cohabited with one unfit for the priesthood] they shall not take; for he is holy to his G d.
21:8	And you shall make him holy, [perforce. (If he refuses to divorce her, lash him and afflict him until he does so)], for he offers up the bread of your G d; holy shall he be unto you [(Relate to him with holiness, having him initiate all things and giving him precedence in blessing at the meal)], for holy am I the L rd, who sanctifies you.
21:9	And the [betrothed or married] daughter of a man who is a Cohein, if she profane herself through fornication, she profanes her father [(They say about him: "Cursed be he who begot such as she! Cursed be he who raised such as she!")]; in fire shall she be burned.
21:10	And the Cohein who is greater than his brothers (i.e., the high-priest), upon whose head the oil of anointment has been poured, and who has been invested to wear the garments — his hair he shall not grow long [for more than thirty days (in mourning)] and his clothes he shall not rend.
21:11	And to any (kol) dead body [(kol) including a revi'ith of blood of a dead person, which causes uncleanliness in a tent)] he shall not come [(into the tent of the dead)]. For his father and for his mother he shall not become unclean, [but he may become unclean for a meth mitzvah].
21:12	And from the sanctuary he shall not go out [He does not follow the litter, and he sacrifices even when he is an onein (before the burial)], and he does not profane the sanctuary of his G d [thereby (But an ordinary Cohein who serves when he is an onein does)], for the crown of the anointing oil of his G d is upon him; I am the L rd.
21:13	And he, a woman in her virginity he shall take.
21:14	A widow, and a divorced woman, and a chalalah [a woman born of those unfit for the priesthood], (and) a harlot — these he shall not take; but only a virgin from his people shall he take as a wife.
21:15	And he shall not profane his seed among his people [(If he does take one of them, his child is a chalal)]; for I am the L rd who makes him holy.
21:16	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
21:17	Speak to Aaron, saying: A man of your seed, through their generations, who will have in him a blemish, shall not come near to offer up the bread [i.e., "the food"] of his G d.
21:18	For any man who has in him a blemish, [by right] should not come near [to do so]: a man who is blind, or lame, or sunken-nosed, or asymmetrical [of limb or organ].
21:19	Or a man who is broken-footed or broken-handed.
21:20	Or gibein [having long, flattened eye-brows] or dak [having a membrane over the eyes] or tevalul [having a disorientation of the black-white arrangement] of his eye, or [having] garav or yalefeth [types of skin conditions] or meroach ashech [having crushed testicles].
21:21	Every man who has a blemish [(Other blemishes are hereby included)] in him [(While it is in him he is pasul; if it leaves, he is kasher)] of the seed of Aaron the Cohein, shall not come near to offer up the fire-offerings of the L rd. There is a blemish in him; the bread of his G d he shall not come near to offer up.
21:22	The bread of his G d, of the holy of holies [(higher-order sanctities)], and of the holies [(lower-order sanctities)], he may eat.
21:23	But to the parocheth [to sprinkle the seven sprinklings] and to the [outer] altar he shall not come near, for a blemish is in him; and he shall not profane My holy places [(If he does serve, the service is profaned and is pasul)]; for I am the L rd who sanctifies them.
21:24	And Moses spoke [(He related) this mitzvah] to Aaron and his sons and to all the children of Israel [(exhorting beth-din vis-à-vis the Cohanim)].
22
22:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
22:2	Speak to Aaron and to his sons that they separate themselves [in the days of their uncleanliness] from the holy things of the children of Israel which they [(including the Cohanim themselves)] make holy unto Me, that they not profane My holy name; I am the L rd.
22:3	Say to them: Throughout your generations, every man who draws near of all of your seed to [eat] the holy things that the children of Israel make holy unto the L rd, with his uncleanliness upon him, that soul will be cut off from before Me; I am the L rd.
22:4	A man of the seed of Aaron, if he is a leper or a zav, of the holy things he shall not eat until he is clean. And one who touches anyone who is unclean through the dead; or a man from whom semen issues,
22:5	Or a man who touches any creeping thing (sheretz) [the (minimum) amount (a lentil-size)] which renders him unclean, or a [dead] man [the (minimum) amount (an olive-size)] which renders him unclean — whatever his uncleanliness [(including touching a zav, a zavah, a niddah, or a yoledeth (a woman who has just given birth)] —
22:6	The soul who touches it [one of the above] shall be unclean until the evening; and he shall not eat of the holy things until he bathes his flesh in water.
22:7	And when the sun sets he shall be clean, and then he may eat of the holy things [terumah], for it is his bread.
22:8	Neveilah or treifah he shall not eat [see 17:15] to defile himself therewith [(If he does eat it, he is forbidden to eat kodshim)]; I am the L rd.
22:9	And they shall keep My charge [not to eat terumah in a state of bodily uncleanliness], that they not bear sin because of it. And they will die for it [(death by the hands of Heaven)] if they profane it; I am the L rd who sanctifies them.
22:10	And every non-priest (zar) shall not eat the holy thing [terumah]. A Cohein's toshav [a servant whose ear is bored, who serves until the Jubilee year] and (his) sachir [a hired servant, who leaves after six years] shall not eat the holy thing, [the Cohein not owning his body].
22:11	And a Cohein, if he acquire a soul [a Canaanite bondsman, whose body he owns], the acquisition of his money [(the Cohein's wife is hereby included)], he may eat of it, and one that is born in his house [(the children of the bondswomen)] — they may eat of his bread.
22:12	And the daughter of a Cohein, if she be wed to a man who is a zar [i.e., a Levite or an Israelite], she, of the terumah of the holy things shall not eat.
22:13	And the daughter of a Cohein, if she be widowed or divorced [from the zar], and she have no seed [from him], then she may return to the house of her father as in her maidenhood (and) from the bread of her father may she eat. And no zar may eat of it, [but a Cohein who is an onein (a mourner) may].
22:14	And a man, if he eat the holy thing [terumah] unwittingly, then he shall add its fifth part upon it and give the Cohein the holy thing [i.e., what can become holy. He does not give him money, but produce of chullin (non-terumah), which becomes terumah].
22:15	And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel [by feeding it to zarim], what they lift to the L rd.
22:16	And they (the Cohanim) will bear upon themselves the sin of guilt when they (the zarim) eat their holy things [things set aside to be terumah]; for I am the L rd who sanctifies them.
22:17	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
22:18	Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the children of Israel, and say to them: A man of the house of Israel and of the stranger in Israel, who brings his offering, of all of their vows ["I take it upon myself to bring, etc."] and of all of their gift offerings ["This (animal) shall be, etc."], which they will present to the L rd as a burnt-offering —
22:19	So that you find favor with it [(in My eyes) shall you bring it. And with what will you find favor?] A male without blemish in the cattle, in the sheep, and in the goats [(but a bird burnt-offering need not be male and unblemished. It becomes pasul only if it lacks a limb.)]
22:20	Whatever has a blemish in it you shall not present, for it will not be acceptable for you.
22:21	And if a man present a sacrifice of peace-offerings to the L rd for an expressed vow or as a gift-offering, of the cattle or of the flock, perfect shall it be for acceptance; no blemish shall be in it.
22:22	[It shall not be] blind or broken or charutz [having an eyelid or a lip that was split or injured], or having a wart or [having] garav or yalefeth [types of skin conditions]. You shall not present these to the L rd. [("You shall not present") — three times (here, 24, 25): to exhort against their being dedicated, slaughtered, and their blood being sprinkled)] And a fire-offering you shall not make of them on the altar to the L rd [(an exhortation against their being smoked)]
22:23	And an ox or a lamb, asymmetrical [of limb] or "closed" [of hoof], a gift [for Temple maintenance] you may make it, but as a vow [for the altar] it shall not be acceptable.
22:24	And [an animal whose membrum or testicles are] bruised [by hand] or crushed, or torn [by hand from their cords but still resting in the scrotum], or cut [by instrument but still resting in the scrotum] you shall not present to the L rd. And in your land [i.e., to all the animals in your land, including unclean ones] you shall not do this [i.e., you shall not castrate them].
22:25	And from the hand of a gentile [who brings an offering through a Cohein] you shall not present the bread of your G d of all these [blemished animals], for their defect is in them. There is a blemish in them; they will not be acceptable [to atone] for you.
22:26	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
22:27	An ox, or a sheep, or a goat, when it is born [(to exclude one delivered by Caesarean section)], it shall be seven days under its mother; and from the eighth day and on, it shall be acceptable as an offering of fire to the L rd.
22:28	And an ox or a lamb, it [the mother] and its son [or daughter] you shall not slaughter in one day.
22:29	And when you slaughter a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the L rd, that it be acceptable for you shall you slaughter it, [viz.,]
22:30	[Slaughter it with the intention that] on that [same] day it will be eaten. You shall leave none of it over until the morning; I am the L rd [Know who decreed this and let it not be light in your eyes.]
22:31	And you shall heed [i.e., study] My mitzvoth and you shall do them; I am the L rd.
22:32	And you shall not profane My holy name [by wittingly transgressing My words], and I shall be sanctified [(Deliver yourself — even unto death — for sanctification of My name)] in the midst of the children of Israel [i.e., in public]; I am the L rd who sanctifies you.
22:33	Who took you out of the land of Egypt [to this end], to be a G d unto you; I am the L rd.
23
23:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
23:2	Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: The festivals of the L rd, which you shall call (them) callings of holiness — these are My festivals. [Make Israel conversant in the times of the festivals, for the year is intercalated for (Jews of) the exile who leave their place for the festival pilgrimage and who have not yet arrived in Jerusalem (by the time of the festival.)]
23:3	Six days shall work be done, and on the seventh day is a Sabbath of resting, a calling of holiness. All work you shall not do; it is Sabbath to the L rd in all your dwellings. [One who desecrates the festivals is considered to have desecrated the Sabbath, and one who keeps the festivals is considered to have kept the Sabbath.]
23:4	These are the festivals of the L rd, callings of holiness which you shall call (them) in their proper times. [The verse here speaks of the proclamation of the New Moon.]
23:5	In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, towards evening [i.e., from the sixth hour (of the day) onwards] is (the time for the sacrifice of) the Paschal offering to the L rd.
23:6	And on the fifteenth day of this month is the festival of matzoth to the L rd. Seven days shall you eat matzoth.
23:7	On the first day, a calling of holiness shall it be for you; all work of labor you shall not do.
23:8	And you shall present a fire-offering [the additional (mussaf) offerings (Numbers 28:19)] to the L rd for a seven day period [(in any event. They are not mutually indispensable. If bullocks are not available, offer the rams, etc.)] On the seventh day is a calling of holiness; all work of labor [i.e., even work which you consider (crucial) labor] you shall not do.
23:9	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
23:10	Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: When you come to the land which I give to you and you reap its harvest, you shall bring the omer [one-tenth of an ephah], the first (grain) of your harvest [i.e., the first grain to be harvested (in your land)] to the Cohein.
23:11	And he shall wave the omer [(back and forth to ward off harmful winds; up and down to ward off harmful dew)] before the L rd for your favor [(if offered as prescribed)]. On the morrow of the Sabbath [i.e., on the morrow of the first day of Pesach] the Cohein shall wave it.
23:12	And you shall offer, on the day that you wave the omer, an unblemished one-year-old lamb [(as adjunct to the omer)], as a burnt-offering to the L rd.
23:13	And its [libation] meal-offering, two-tenths [(double the normal amount)] of fine flour mixed with oil, a fire-offering to the L rd, a sweet savor; and its drink-offering, wine, a fourth of a hin [(the normal amount)].
23:14	And bread, and kali [flour made from karmel (tender ears) dried in an oven] and karmel [the ears themselves] you shall not eat until this self-same day, until you have brought the offering of your G d; a statute for ever, throughout your generations, in all of your dwellings [("dwellings"): Some say, even outside Eretz Yisrael; others, in Eretz Yisrael, after inheritance and settlement)].
23:15	And you shall count for yourselves from the morrow of the Sabbath [see 11], from the day that you bring the omer of the waving; seven complete [(the counting starting from the evening)] Sabbaths, they shall be.
23:16	Until [but not including] the morrow of the seventh week, the fiftieth day, shall you count [forty-nine days], and you shall offer a new meal-offering to the L rd [("new"): the first (wheat) meal-offering brought from the new produce, (the omer meal-offering, unlike all others, being brought from barley)].
23:17	From your habitations [(and not from outside Eretz Yisrael)] shall you bring two breads of lifting [i.e., "lifted" to the Most High (this being the "new meal-offering" 16)]. Two-tenths of fine flour shall they be. Leavened shall they be baked, first to the L rd [of all the meal-offerings. Even the meal-offering of jealousy (Numbers 5:15), which comes from barley, is not to be offered of the new produce before the two breads.]
23:18	And you shall present with the bread [i.e., as requisite for the bread] seven unblemished one-year-old lambs, and one young bullock, and two rams. They shall be a burnt-offering and their drink-offerings [as per the specifications for meal-offerings and drink-offerings (Numbers 28:12-14)], a fire-offering, a sweet savor to the L rd.
23:19	And you shall offer one kid of the goats as a sin-offering and two one-year-old lambs as a sacrifice of peace-offerings. [Note: The seven lambs (18) and the goat mentioned here are not the same as those mentioned in Numbers 28:27-30, these being brought as a requirement for the bread, and the others as mussafin (additional offerings)].
23:20	And the Cohein shall lift them with the first-bread, a lifting before the L rd. (He lifts the bread) with the two lambs [(and not with all of the animals mentioned)]. Holy [i.e., holy of holies] shall they [these communal peace-offerings] be [(unlike individual peace-offerings, which are of a lower order of holiness)] to the L rd, to the Cohein.
23:21	And you shall call out on this self-same day; a holy calling shall there be for you. All work of labor you shall not do, a statute forever, in all of your habitations, throughout your generations.
23:22	And when you harvest the harvest of your land, do not end off the corner (peah) of your field in your reaping. [This is mentioned a second time (see 19:9) to posit liability for transgression of two negative commandments]; and the gleaning (leket) of your harvest you shall not gather. To the poor man and to the stranger shall you leave them [(Leave it for them and let them gather it; do not assist any particular one of them)]; I am the L rd your G d. [This is inserted in the midst of the festivals to teach that if one gives leket, shikchah, and peah to the poor as prescribed, it is accounted to him as if he had built the Temple and offered up his sacrifices therein.]
23:23	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
23:24	Speak to the children of Israel, saying: On the seventh month, on the first day of the month, there shall be for you a resting, [verses of] remembrance (zichronoth) [and verses of (i.e., evocative of)] the shofar blast (shofroth), a holy calling.
23:25	All work of labor you shall not do, and you shall present a fire-offering to the L rd.
23:26	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
23:27	Only, on the tenth day of this seventh month it is the day of atonement [("Only") — Only those who repent are granted atonement.] A holy calling shall it be for you. And you shall afflict your souls and you shall present a fire-offering to the L rd.
23:28	And all work you shall not do on this self-same day; for it is a day of atonement to atone for you before the L rd your G d.
23:29	For every soul which will not be afflicted on this self-same day will be cut off from its people.
23:30	And every soul that shall do any work on this self-same day, I shall make that soul go lost from the midst of its people. [Thus, "cutting-off" (kareth), as in verse 29, is destruction.]
23:31	All work you shall not do [(This posits transgression of numerous negative commandments, (or it is an exhortation against labor on the night as well as the day (of Yom Kippur)], an everlasting statute, throughout your generations, in all of your dwellings.
23:32	A Sabbath of resting shall it be for you, and you shall afflict your souls; on the ninth day of the month in the evening, from evening until evening, shall you rest your resting.
23:33	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
23:34	Speak to the children of Israel, saying: On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the festival of Succoth, seven days to the L rd.
23:35	On the first day is a holy calling [Sanctify it (Yom Kippur) with clean garments and with prayer, (and the other festivals with food and drink, clean garments and prayer)]; all work of labor you shall not do.
23:36	Seven days shall you present a fire-offering to the L rd. On the eighth day a holy calling shall there be for you, and you shall present a fire-offering to the L rd. It is a "holding back" (atzereth) [the L rd saying, as it were: "I have held you back with Me, it being difficult for Me to part with you")]; all work of labor [see 23:8] you shall not do. [("It is a holding back") — but on Chol Hamoed (the intermediate days of the festival) "work of labor" is permitted.]
23:37	These are the festivals of the L rd, which you shall call holy callings to present a fire-offering to the L rd, a burnt-offering and a meal-offering [(the libation meal-offering, which is offered up together with the burnt-offering)], sacrifice and drink-offerings, the thing of the day [(as prescribed in Numbers)] in its day [(but if the day passed, its sacrifice is forfeited)].
23:38	Aside from the Sabbaths of the L rd, and aside from your gifts, and aside from all your vows and aside from all your gift-offerings that you give to the L rd.
23:39	But [(since the festival peace-offering (chagigah) can be brought on any one of the seven days, it does not override the Sabbath)] on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you gather in the produce of the land [(Intercalate the years so that this harvest festival does not fall out sometimes in the middle of the summer, sometimes in the middle of the winter)], you shall celebrate [with the chagigah] the festival of the L rd seven days [(If you did not bring the chagigah on one of the seven, you may bring it on another)]; on the first day, a resting, and on the eighth day, a resting.
23:40	And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of a tree [(the fruit tasting like the tree)] which is hadar, [which lives (hadar, i.e., is produced) on its tree from year to year — an ethrog], a branch of date-palms, a branch of a plaited tree [(a tree the branches of which are plaited like ropes — a myrtle)], and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the L rd your G d seven days.
23:41	And you shall celebrate it [("it"): The chagigah is brought on only one of the days)] as a festival to the L rd seven days in the year, a statute forever throughout your generations; on the seventh month shall you celebrate it.
23:42	In succoth shall you sit seven days; every citizen in Israel [including proselytes] shall sit in succoth.
23:43	So that your generations know that in succoth [clouds of glory] did I cause the children of Israel to dwell when I took them out of the land of Egypt; I am the L rd your G d.
23:44	And Moses proclaimed the festivals of the L rd to the children of Israel.
24
24:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
24:2	Command the children of Israel that they bring to you clear olive oil [(the first of the three oils issuing from the olive)], (the olives), crushed for illumination, to raise a light continually [(from night to night, like the "continual" — from day to day — burnt-offering)]. [This is the section of the mitzvah of the lamps. Exodus 27:20 (in this connection) is to be understood as: "And you are destined to command, etc." (the actual command taking place here.) It is mentioned there, in connection with the account of the construction of the tabernacle, only to explain the function of the menorah.]
24:3	Outside the parocheth, [which is before] the Testimony [i.e., the ark], in the tent of meeting, shall Aaron arrange it (the menorah) [so that it burn] from evening until morning before the L rd continually, an eternal statute throughout your generations.
24:4	On the pure [gold] menorah shall he arrange the lamps before the L rd always.
24:5	And you shall take fine flour and you shall bake it (into) twelve challoth; two-tenths (of an ephah) shall the one challah be.
24:6	And you shall place them in two rows, six in a row, on the pure [gold] table before the L rd.
24:7	And you shall place upon the two [i.e., upon each of the two rows pure frankincense [(On each of the two rows there were two cups of frankincense, a fistful in each)]. And it shall be a memorial for the bread [(For nothing of the bread was offered on high, but the incense was burned when they removed the bread each Sabbath. By the incense, then, the bread is "remembered" (in the same way that the fistful is a "memorial" for the meal-offering)], a fire-offering to the L rd.
24:8	On the day of Sabbath, on the day of Sabbath, he shall arrange it before the L rd always; from the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant.
24:9	And it [this meal-offering (everything coming from grain being in the category of "meal-offering")] shall be for Aaron and for his sons. And they shall eat it [the bread] in a holy place, for holy of holies is it to him, of the fire-offerings of the L rd, an everlasting statute.
24:10	And there went out the son of an Israelite woman, and he was the son of an Egyptian man, [the one slain by Moses (Exodus 2:11-12)], in the midst of the children of Israel [(He had become a proselyte)], and they strove in the camp [i.e., regarding matters of the camp], the son of the Israelite woman and the Israelite man [who opposed him].
24:11	And the son of the Israelite woman indited the [ineffable] Name [the Tetragrammaton, that he had heard at Sinai], and he blasphemed, and they brought him to Moses. And the name of his mother was Shlomith [(She said "Shalom," promiscuously, to all)] the daughter of Divri [(She was a "prattler" (dabranith), speaking indiscriminately to all men)], of the tribe of Dan [(an encomium to Israel — she alone went astray)]
24:12	And they placed him [alone] in confinement, that it be specified to them by the mouth of the L rd [whether or not he was to be killed].
24:13	And the L rd said to Moses, saying:
24:14	Take the curser outside the camp, and let all [(including the judges)], who heard [(These are the witnesses)] place their hands on his head [(They say to him: Your blood is on your own head, and not upon us; you brought it upon yourself)], and let all the congregation stone him [i.e., let him be stoned in the presence of the entire congregation (whence it is derived that one's emissary is like himself)].
24:15	And to the children of Israel, you shall speak, saying: A man, if he curse his G d, then he shall bear his sin [In the absence of warning, he incurs kareth.]
24:16	And one who indites the Name of the L rd [the Tetragrammaton (but not an epithet)] shall be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him. Proselyte, like born-Jew — if he indites the Name he shall die.
24:17	And a man, if he smite [i.e., kill] any soul of man [(including women and minors)] shall be put to death.
24:18	And one that smites [i.e., kills] a beast shall make compensation for it, life for life.
24:19	And a man, if he maims (lit., "gives an injury to") his neighbor — as he did, so shall it be done to him.
24:20	A breaking for a breaking, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth — as he gives an injury to a man, so shall it [money] be given by him [in compensation for the injury. He (the injured one) is assessed as a slave (and he is given the difference between the value of a slave with this injury and one without it)].
24:21	And one who strikes [i.e., wounds] a beast shall make compensation for it. And one who strikes [i.e., wounds] a man [i.e., his parent, (when he is alive, comparable to "beast")] shall be put to death.
24:22	One judgment shall there be for you; for proselyte as for born-Jew shall it be, for I am the L rd your G d [— the G d of all of you. Just as I unite My name with you, so do I unite it with the proselytes].
24:23	And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and they took the curser outside the camp, and they stoned him with stones, and the children of Israel did as the L rd commanded Moses [in respect to stoning (see Exodus 19:13 and Deuteronomy 21:22)].
Behar
25
25:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai [(Just as the general rules and specific ordinances of shemitah (the sabbatical year) were given at Sinai, so, with all the mitzvoth)], saying:
25:2	Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: When you come to the land that I give to you, the land shall rest a Sabbath to the L rd [i.e., in the name of the L rd.]
25:3	Six years shall you sow your field and six years shall you prune your vineyard, and you shall collect its produce.
25:4	And in the seventh year, a Sabbath of resting shall there be for the land [i.e., for the fields and for the vineyards], a Sabbath to the L rd; your field you shall not sow, and your vineyard you shall not prune.
25:5	The after-growth of your harvest [i.e., what fell there at harvest time] you shall not reap [i.e., you shall not take possession of it], and the grapes of your guarded vine [i.e., your vine which you did not render hefker (ownerless)] you shall not gather; a year of rest shall there be for the land.
25:6	And the resting of the land [i.e., your "non-guarded" (hefker) land] shall be for you to eat: for you, and your man-servant, and your maid-servant, and your hired man, and your sojourners who dwell with you.
25:7	And for your beast and for the animal which is in your land shall be all its produce to eat. [So long as the animal eats from the field (i.e., so long as produce is found in the field), you may feed it to your beast from (what you have stored) in the house. If it has ended for the animal in the field, "end it" (i.e., remove it) for your beast from the house.]
25:8	And you shall count for yourself seven Sabbaths [i.e., shemitoth] of years — seven [shemitah] years, seven [discrete] times [(and not seven consecutive shemitah years)] — and the seven Sabbaths of years will be for you forty-nine years.
25:9	And you shall sound the shofar [in proclamation of the Jubilee] in the seventh month on the tenth day of the month. On the day of atonement shall you sound the shofar throughout the land.
25:10	And you shall sanctify the fiftieth year [(At its advent it is sanctified in beth-din: "The year is sanctified!")], and you shall call out freedom [for all (Hebrew) bondsmen] in the land, to all its inhabitants. "Yovel" (Jubilee) [lit., "the shofar"] shall it [(the name of the year)] be for you. And you shall return a man to his holding [(Fields return to their original owners)]; and a man to his family [(including the bondsman whose ear has been bored)] shall you return.
25:11	It is a Jubilee year; the fiftieth year shall be for you. You shall not sow, and you shall not reap its aftergrowth, and you shall not glean (the grapes of) its guarded vine. [What applies to shemitah applies to Yovel, so that there are two consecutive sanctities, the forty-ninth year — shemitah, and the fiftieth year — Yovel.]
25:12	For it is a Jubilee year; holy shall it be for you [It (the "holiness" of the produce of that year) is transferred to its monies (those given in exchange for it) as is the case with (the redemption of) hekdesh (sacred property). I might think that it (the "redeemed" produce itself) becomes chullin (non-consecrated); it is, therefore, written "shall it be"; it remains in its state of holiness.] From the field [i.e., on the basis of what transpires in the field], you may eat its produce [that is stored in the house (see 25:7)].
25:13	In the year of this Jubilee shall you return, each man, to his holding [(to include a field sold by a man and redeemed by his son as returning to the father on Yovel)].
25:14	And if you sell a selling to your fellow, or acquire from the hand of your fellow, you shall not wrong [(money wronging)], one man, his brother.
25:15	According to the number of years after the Jubilee year shall you buy from your fellow [i.e., Set the price according to the number of years remaining to the Yovel, when the field will return to the owner — a higher price for more years remaining; a proportionately lower price for less]; according to the number of years of crops shall he sell to you. [(It must be sold for at least two years of crops (and not blight)].
25:16	According to the numerousness of years shall you increase its price, and according to the fewness of years shall you diminish its price; for a number of crops (until the Yovel) he sells to you (and not the field itself.)
25:17	And you shall not wrong [(verbal wronging)] one man, his fellow [by taunting him or giving him improper advice.] And you shall fear your G d, [who knows your intentions]. For I am the L rd your G d.
25:18	And you shall observe My statutes, and My judgments shall you keep and do them, and you shall dwell on the land secure. [For non-observance of shemitah results in exile (see 26:34). (The seventy years of Babylonian exile were for seventy shemitoth that were not observed.)]
25:19	And the land will give its fruit, and you will eat to satiety [(the food will be "blessed" in your innards)], and you will dwell securely thereon [without fear of drought].
25:20	And if you say: What shall we eat in the seventh year if we cannot sow or gather [into the house] our produce [like wine and fruits and after-growth, which falls of itself (and is not "sown," see 5)],
25:21	I shall command My blessing for you in the sixth year, and it shall produce the crop for three years: [for Nissan (of the sixth year until Rosh HaShanah), for the seventh year, and for the eighth year until Nissan, (for in the eighth year, they will sow in Cheshvan and harvest in Nissan)].
25:22	And you shall sow in the eighth year, and you shall eat of the old (sixth year) crop. Until the [Sukkoth of the] ninth year, until its [the eighth year's] produce comes [into the house, (the eighth year crop being stored in field granaries all summer and being brought into the house only in Tishrei)], you shall eat of the old crop.
25:23	And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity [(a negative commandment directed to the buyer, against non-return of the field in Yovel)], for Mine is the land, [and not yours (so that you need not feel "put out" in returning it)]; for strangers and sojourners are you with Me.
25:24	And in all the land of your holding, redemption shall you give to the land. [(This introduces what follows, that one who sells his holding may redeem it after two years and the buyer cannot refuse him)].
25:25	If your brother grows poor and sells of his holding [(but not all of his holding — he should leave a field for himself) (It is derived from here that one should not sell his field unless he is sorely pressed by poverty)], then his redeemer who is near to him shall come and he shall redeem what his brother has sold [and the buyer cannot refuse him].
25:26	And a man, if there be for him no redeemer [who is able to redeem what he has sold], and his hand attains, and he finds what suffices for its redemption,
25:27	Then he shall reckon the years of its sale [i.e., the value of the yearly crops from the time of its sale], and he shall return the balance [the difference between the yearly crop values and the sales price] to the man to whom he sold it, and he shall return to his holding.
25:28	And if his hand does not find what suffices to restore it to himself [(— whence it is derived that he may not redeem it by halves)], then his selling shall remain in the hand of its buyer until the Jubilee year, [the Jubilee year "releasing" it immediately upon its advent], and it shall go out in the Jubilee year, and he shall return to his holding.
25:29	And a man, if he sells a house of dwelling in a city with a wall [from the time of Joshua the son of Nun], then its redemption shall be [only] until the end of the year of its sale [with no possibility of redemption thereafter]; [a year of] days shall be its redemption.
25:30	And if it is not redeemed until there is filled for it a complete year, then the house which is in the city which had a wall [(in the time of Joshua, though it may not have one now)] shall stand in perpetuity to the one who bought it throughout his generations; it shall not go out in the Jubilee year [if the Jubilee year arrived in the midst of the year of sale.]
25:31	And the houses of open cities, which have no wall roundabout, as the field of the land shall they be reckoned [i.e., they may be redeemed until Yovel, and (if not redeemed) Yovel releases them to their original owners.] Redemption shall there be for it, [immediately, if the seller so wishes], and in the Jubilee year shall it go out [gratis].
25:32	And the cities of the Levites [the forty-eight cities which were given to them (Numbers 35:6-7)], the houses of the cities of their holding, a perpetual redemption shall there be for the Levites. [In the instance of a field, they may redeem immediately (and need not wait two years), and, in the instance of a house in a walled city they may redeem forever (and the house does not become irredeemable after a year)].
25:33	And if a man purchase [a house or a city] of the Levites, then the selling of the house or of the city of his holding shall go out in the Jubilee year, [and not be irredeemable like the walled-city houses of Israelites]. For the houses of the cities of the Levites are their holding in the midst of the children of Israel. [The Levites did not have fields and vineyards as inheritances; therefore, their houses and open lots are their holdings in place of fields and are redeemable like fields, so that their inheritance not depart from them.]
25:34	And the field of the open place around their cities may not be sold [by the Temple treasurer, i.e., If a Levite dedicated it to the Temple, and did not redeem it, and the treasurer sold it, it does not revert to the Cohanim in the Jubilee year (as it does in the case of an Israelite (see 27:16-20), but the Levite may always redeem it], for it is a perpetual holding for them.
25:35	And if your brother grows poor and his hand falls with you, then you shall uphold him [from the time of the falling of his hand], [even if he be] proselyte or sojourner (toshav) [one who took it upon himself not to serve idolatry, but who eats neveiloth]; and he shall live with you.
25:36	You shall not take from him interest (neshech) or increase (tarbith) [(Though neshech and tarbith are one and the same, they are stated as two to posit liability for transgression of two negative commandments)], and you shall fear your G d, [who knows your thoughts, and do not resort to rationalizations for the taking of interest]. And your brother shall live with you.
25:37	Your money you shall not give him on interest, and on increase you shall not give your food.
25:38	I am the L rd your G d who took you out of the land of Egypt [(I discriminated between a first-born and a non first-born, and I can also discern and exact punishment from one who lends his money to a Jew on interest on the pretence that it is a gentile's)] to give you the land of Canaan [as reward for accepting My mitzvoth], to be a G d to you [(For all who live in Eretz Yisrael are considered to have a G d, and all who depart from it are as worshippers of idolatry.)]
25:39	And if your brother grows poor with you, and he is sold to you, do not work with him the [demeaning] services of a bondsman, [like carrying your things after you to the bathhouse or putting on your shoes for you.]
25:40	As a hired man and as a sojourner shall he be with you [Employ him for the tilling of the soil and for craft work, like other hired laborers.] Until the Jubilee year shall he work with you [(If the Jubilee year intervenes before the expiration of his six years, it releases him.)]
25:41	And he shall go out from you, he and his children with him [ — whence it is derived (since his children had not actually been sold with him) that his master is responsible for the feeding of his children]. And he shall return to his family, and to the holding of his fathers shall he return. [He is to be restored to his former dignity and not demeaned for his prior servitude.]
25:42	For they are My servants [(My "deeds" came first)], whom I took out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves are sold [on the auction block, by proclamation: "Slave for sale!"]
25:43	You shall not rule over him oppressively [(Do not impose on him services that you have no need of.)] And, [lest you say: No one knows that I am working him gratuitously —] you shall fear your G d, [who knows your heart].
25:44	And, [if you say: If so, who will serve me? I am forbidden to rule over my (Hebrew) bondsman, and I am commanded to destroy the seven nations!] — your bondsman and your bondswoman whom you may have — from the nations who are roundabout you, [and not those within your land], from them shall you buy a bondsman and a bondswoman.
25:45	And also of the sons of the sojourners, who sojourn among you, [who came from roundabout you to take wives in your land, and who begot children (the children having the status of the father, so that they are not subsumed in (Deuteronomy 20:16): "You shall not allow any soul to live")] — from them (the sojourners) may you buy, and their families that are with you, that they begot in your land, and they shall be a holding for you.
25:46	And you shall hold them as an inheritance for your sons after you to inherit as a holding. Forever shall you have them serve you. And in your brothers, the children of Israel, one man over his brother [including a leader over his people and a king over his ministers], you shall not rule over him oppressively.
25:47	And if the hand of a stranger-sojourner attain (wealth) with you [(What caused him to attain wealth? His clinging "with you")], and your brother grow poor with him [(What caused him to become poor? His clinging "with him")], and he be sold to the stranger-sojourner with you, or to the uprooted [i.e., idolatry] of the family of a stranger [i.e., if he is sold to be a servant of idolatry — to hew wood, draw water, and the like],
25:48	After he is sold, redemption shall there be for him [immediately. (Do not allow him to become assimilated with them)]; one of his brothers shall redeem him.
25:49	Or his uncle, or his uncle's son shall redeem him; or those of his near of kin, of his family, shall redeem him; or, if his hand attain, he shall be redeemed (by himself).
25:50	And he shall reckon with his buyer [(Even if the gentile who bought him be subservient to you, make a "straight reckoning" with him (to avoid desecration of the Name)], from the year that he was sold to him until the Jubilee year, [when he would, in any event, be released]. And the money of his selling will be according to the number of years [that he served him]. According to the days of a hired man shall he be with him [i.e., the buyer receives the difference between the purchase price and the wages of a hired man for the period that he serves him (that wage being determined proportionately, per year, by the purchase price divided by the number of years until the Jubilee year)].
25:51	If there are yet many in the years [until the Jubilee year], according to them shall he return his redemption (money) from the money of his acquisition.
25:52	And if few are left in the years until the Jubilee year, then he shall reckon with him; according to his years shall he return his redemption.
25:53	As a hired man, year by year, shall he be with him; he shall not rule over him oppressively before your eyes.
25:54	And if he is not redeemed with these [(He is redeemed only with "these," and not after six years)], then he shall go out in the Jubilee year, he and his children with him [see 25:41].
25:55	For unto Me are the children of Israel servants. They are My servants, whom I took out of the land of Egypt. I am the L rd your G d.
26
26:1	[The following is addressed to a Jew who sold himself to a gentile, and who might come to say: Since my master serves idols, I, likewise, may do so, etc.] You shall not make for yourselves idols, and a graven image or a pillar you shall not upraise for yourselves, and a covering stone [(a stone pavement covering the ground)] shall you not make in your land to prostrate (yourselves) upon it [even unto Heaven (this being permitted only in the Temple)], for I am the L rd your G d.
26:2	My Sabbaths shall you keep, and My sanctuary shall you fear; I am the L rd [trusted to reward].
Bechukothai
26:3	If in My statutes you walk [i.e., If in My Torah you toil], and My mitzvoth you keep [that is, if you toil in My Torah in order to keep My mitzvoth and to fulfill them], and you do them,
26:4	Then I shall give your rains in their [proper] times [i.e., when people are not generally found out of doors], and the earth will yield its produce and the tree of the field [i.e., the normally barren tree] will yield its fruit.
26:5	And your threshing [will be so abundant that it] will reach for you [until] the [time of the] vintage [harvest] and the vintage will reach the sowing, and you will eat your bread to satiety [i.e., you will eat but little, and the food will be "blessed" in your innards], and you will dwell secure in your land.
26:6	And [(lest you say: Food and drink without peace is nothing)], I will put peace, [which is over and against all,] in the land, and you will lie down and not tremble; and I will eliminate evil beasts from the land, and a sword shall not pass through your land, [even a sword of "peace" (i.e., an army passing through Eretz Yisrael to attack a different land)].
26:7	And you will pursue your enemies, and they will fall before you by the sword, [one by the sword of the other].
26:8	And there will pursue of you [(even of the weakest)] — five, one hundred; and one hundred of you will pursue ten thousand [(and not "five hundred, ten thousand," as expected proportionately, there being no comparing a small number of Torah observers to a large one)], and your enemies will fall before you [an unnatural falling] by the sword.
26:9	And I will turn [My regard exclusively] to you [to reward you], and I will make you fruitful [in childbearing], and I will give you an upright stature, and I will establish My covenant with you, [not like the first covenant which you broke, but a new covenant, which will not be broken.]
26:10	And you will eat the old [crop] grown old [The produce will be so well preserved that a three-year-old crop will be better to eat than last year's], and you will remove the old [from the overflowing granaries] to make place for the new.
26:11	And I will place My mishkan [the Temple] in your midst, and My soul will not repel you.
26:12	And I will walk [in Gan Eden] in your midst [as one of you, and you will not be in terror of Me] and [lest you think you will not fear Me], I will be to you as a G d, and you will be to Me as a people.
26:13	I am the L rd your G d, who took you out of the land of Egypt [You may well believe Me capable of doing all these things, for I took you out of the land of Egypt with great wonders] that you not be slaves to them, and I broke the bars of your yoke, and I made you walk upright.
26:14	And if you do not hearken [(to toil in Torah to know the exegeses of the sages)] to Me, [i.e., rebelling "to My face" (knowing your Creator and willing to rebel against Him)], and, [as a result of not hearkening,] you will not do all of these mitzvoth [(thus far, two transgressions)],
26:15	And if [as a result of not doing], you despise [the doers of] My statutes, and if [as a result] your souls repel [(the exemplifiers of)] My ordinances, [the sages], so that [as a result] there not be done [i.e., you prevent others from doing] all of My mitzvoth [i.e., As a result, you deny that they are My mitzvoth], to break My covenant [i.e., as a result, you deny Me! — in all, seven transgressions],
26:16	I, too, will do this to you, and I will command panic upon you — consumption, and burning fever, making the eyes languish [in vain hope of recovery] and grieving the soul [of your family in your death], and you will sow your seed in vain, [for it will not sprout], and, [if it does sprout], your foes will eat it.
26:17	And I will turn My regard against you, and you will be smitten before your foes, and your haters shall rule over you, and you will flee [in fear] when none pursue you, [being powerless (to threaten them)].
26:18	And if while these [are yet upon you] you do not hearken to Me, then I will chastise you even more — seven-fold, for your [seven] sins [see 15].
26:19	And I shall break the pride of your strength [the Temple], and I shall make your skies as iron and your earth as brass.
26:20	And your strength [in plowing, sowing, etc.] shall be spent in vain, and your land will not yield [even] what is brought to it [at sowing time], and the tree of the land will not yield [(It will be smitten in point of the land, the land not fructifying at blooming time)] its fruit [(It will also be smitten in point of its fruit, any fruit that is produced, falling — two curses; all together, seven punishments)].
26:21	And if you walk with Me in obduracy, and you will not wish to hearken to Me, then I shall smite you even more — seven, according to your [seven] sins [i.e., seven other punishments for your seven sins].
26:22	And I will incite against you the animal of the field [(two more punishments, viz. (Deuteronomy 32:24): "and the teeth of (domestic) beasts will I send against them," and (Ibid.): "with the venom of crawling things of the dust" (i.e., death by biting)], and it will bereave you (of your children), and it will cut off your cattle [outside (the city)] and it will reduce you [inside], and your roads [both large and small] will be desolate [ — all together, seven punishments].
26:23	And if with these you will not be chastised [to return] to Me, and you will walk with Me in obduracy,
26:24	Then I, too, will walk with you in obduracy, and I, too, will smite you seven, for your [seven] sins.
26:25	And I will bring upon you a sword [i.e., an army], avenging the vengeance of [i.e., foretold in] the Covenant [the Torah], and you will be gathered together [because of the siege] into your cities, and I will send pestilence in your midst, and, [as a result because they were not permitted to leave the dead in Jerusalem overnight and were constrained to take them outside for burial)], you will be delivered into the hand of the foe.
26:26	When I break your staff of bread [i.e., When I bring famine upon you], ten women shall bake your bread in one oven [for lack of wood], and they shall [sit and] dole out your bread by weight [(for the wheat will be rotten and the loaf will crumble)]. And you will eat and not be sated, [the bread being "cursed" in your intestines — all together, seven punishments].
26:27	And if with this you will not hearken to Me, but walk with Me in obduracy,
26:28	Then I will walk with you in the fury of obduracy, and I, too, will chastise you, seven, for your sins.
26:29	And you will eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters will you eat.
26:30	And I will destroy your high places [your towers and castles], and I will cut down your [idolatrous] sun pillars [(which they set up on roofs)], and I will cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols [(They would take their idols from their bosoms and kiss them, their hunger-swollen bellies would burst, and they would fall upon them)], and My soul will repel you.
26:31	And I will make your cities waste [of passersby], and I will make desolate your sanctified ones [i.e., the (festival) pilgrims, who used to sanctify themselves to ascend there], and I will not smell your sweet savors [ — all together, seven punishments].
26:32	And I will make desolate the land, and your foes who dwell therein will be awe-struck thereby [(a "goodly provision" for Israel — its foes will find no satisfaction in the land, it being desolate of its inhabitants)].
26:33	And you, will I scatter among the nations [so that you lack even the consolation of togetherness], and I will draw out the sword after you, and your land will be desolate [(You will not quickly return there)], and [(as a result)] your cities will be waste [(You will perceive them as "ruined," not expecting to return there)].
26:34	Then shall the land requite its Sabbaths [It will appease the wrath of the King over its unobserved shemitoth (sabbatical and Jubilee years)], all the days of its desolation — and you in the land of your foes! [see 25:18]. Then shall the land rest and it shall requite its Sabbaths.
26:35	All the days of its desolation it shall rest — what it did not rest in your [seventy] sabbatical years when you dwelt upon it [(in sin) four hundred and thirty years].
26:36	And those who are left of you — I will bring terror into their hearts in the lands of their foes, and they will be chased by the sound of a driven leaf, and they will flee as one flees the sword, and they will fall though none pursue.
26:37	And they will stumble [in their panic] one man against the other, as if [they were fleeing] before the sword, though none pursue; and there will be no rising for you before your foes.
26:38	And you will go lost [from each other by being scattered] among the nations, and the land of your foes will devour you [(The allusion is to those who die in exile)].
26:39	And those that are left of you will melt away in their sins in the land of their enemies; and also with the sins of their fathers with them [i.e., which they continue to hold onto] will they melt away.
26:40	And they will confess their sin and the sin of their fathers, their faithlessness wherein they betrayed Me, and also their having walked with Me in obduracy [see 21]
26:41	I, too, will walk with them in obduracy, and I [Myself] will bring them into the land of their foes. [This is providential for Israel, viz.: I shall not allow them to become assimilated, though they see no other recourse, but I will raise up My prophets and bring them back under the wings of the Shechinah.] If then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and then they requite their sin [i.e., if they atone for their sin through their afflictions],
26:42	Then I will remember My covenant with Jacob, and also My covenant with Isaac, and also My covenant with Abraham will I remember [(If Jacob, the "smallest" of the patriarchs is not worthy enough (to atone for them) then Isaac is with him, etc. ("remember" is not mentioned in respect to Isaac, for his ashes on the altar (of the akeidah) are always present to His sight)], and the land will I remember.
26:43	And the land will be abandoned of them, and it will requite its Sabbaths in being desolate of them, and they will requite their sins — in retribution and in retribution — [because] they rejected My ordinances and because their souls repelled My statutes.
26:44	And notwithstanding all this [i.e., that I shall bring this retribution upon them], while they are in the land of their foes, I will not reject them and I will not repel them to destroy them, to break My covenant with them, for I am the L rd their G d.
26:45	And I will remember for them the covenant of the first ones [the tribes], whom I took out of the land of Egypt before the eyes of the nations to be a G d unto them; I am the L rd.
26:46	These are the statutes and the ordinances and the Toroth [the written and the oral laws (both having been given to Moses at Sinai)], which the L rd gave between Himself and the children of Israel on Mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
27
27:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
27:2	Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: A man, if he utter a vow in valuation of lives to the L rd [i.e., If he says: "I vow to give (to the Temple) the valuation of this and this organ" (on which life depends)],
27:3	Then the (fixed) valuation shall be: For the male, from twenty to sixty years, the valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver in the shekel of the sanctuary.
27:4	And if she is female, the valuation shall be thirty shekels.
27:5	And if from five years [(i.e., If an adult said: I vow to give the valuation of this five-year-old)] until twenty years, then the valuation shall be, for a male, twenty shekels, and for a female, ten shekels.
27:6	And if from one month until five years, then the valuation shall be: for a male, five shekels of silver; and for a female, the valuation, three shekels of silver.
27:7	And if from sixty years and above: If a male, then the valuation shall be fifteen shekels; and if a female, ten shekels.
27:8	And if he (the vower) be too poor for the [fixed] valuation, then he [the one to be valuated] shall be stood before the Cohein, and the Cohein shall valuate him. According to the means of the vower shall the Cohein valuate him [and leave enough for subsistence: bed, mattress, pillows, tools, and the like].
27:9	And if it be a beast, of which men present an offering to the L rd, all that he gives of it to the L rd shall be holy. [If he said: "The foot of this animal for a burnt-offering," he sells it to be offered as a burnt-offering, and the money he receives, excluding the value of that limb, is chullin (non-consecrated)].
27:10	He shall not exchange it and he shall not substitute for it, good [an unblemished animal] for bad [a blemished animal] or bad for good [(and certainly not good for good or bad for bad)]. And if he substitutes beast for beast, then it and its substitute shall be holy.
27:11	And if any unclean beast [a blemished beast, which is "unclean" for offering (whence it is seen that unblemished consecrated animals are not redeemable unless they sustain a blemish)], which they may not present of it as an offering to the L rd, then he shall stand the beast before the Cohein.
27:12	And the Cohein shall valuate it, whether good or bad; as the Cohein valuates it, so shall it be [(for others who come to buy it from the Temple)].
27:13	And if he [the owner] would redeem it, then he shall add its fifth to the valuation.
27:14	And if a man consecrate his house, holy to the L rd, then the Cohein shall valuate it, whether good or bad; as the Cohein shall valuate it, so shall it stand [for others].
27:15	And if the consecrator [himself] would redeem his house, then he shall add a fifth of the valuation upon it, and it shall be his.
27:16	And if from the field of his holding a man shall consecrate to the L rd, then the valuation shall be according to its sowing; the sowing of a chomer of barley, for fifty silver shekels.
27:17	If from [i.e., immediately after] the Jubilee year he shall consecrate [and immediately come to redeem] his field, according to the [above] valuation [a chomer of barley for fifty silver shekels] shall it stand.
27:18	And if after the Jubilee year he shall consecrate his field, [and it remain with the Temple treasurer, and he comes to redeem it (some time) after the Jubilee year], the Cohein shall reckon for him the money (to be returned to the Temple) according to the years remaining until the Jubilee year, and it [the (value of the) number of years from the (preceding) Jubilee year until the year of redemption] shall be deducted from the (original total) valuation.
27:19	And if the consecrator (himself) would redeem the field, then he shall add a fifth of the money of the valuation upon it, and it shall be his.
27:20	And if he [the consecrator] does not redeem the field, and he [the Temple treasurer] sells the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed again [i.e., It does not return to the consecrator (as a field of holding)].
27:21	But the field shall be, when it goes out on the Jubilee year [from the one who bought it from the treasurer], holy to the L rd, as a devoted field. To the Cohein shall be his holding [i.e., to the Cohanim of that watch on which the Yom Kippur of the Jubilee falls out.]
27:22	And if the field of his acquisition (from another), which is not of the field of his (family) holding, he shall consecrate to the L rd, [and he comes to redeem it],
27:23	Then the Cohein shall reckon for him the worth of the valuation until the Jubilee year, and he shall give the valuation on that day, holy to the L rd.
27:24	[And if he does not redeem it and the treasurer sells it to another, or if he himself redeemed it, then] in the year of the Jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom he [the consecrator] bought it, to the one who has the holding of the land.
27:25	And all valuations [concerning which it is written "shekalim"] shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary; twenty gerah shall the shekel be. [(Thus they were in the beginning; afterwards they added a sixth.)]
27:26	But a first-born, which is a firstling to the L rd among the beasts, a man shall not consecrate it [as a different offering, for it is not his (see Numbers 18:17)]; whether ox or lamb, it is the L rd's.
27:27	And if (he wishes to redeem) an unclean beast [that he dedicated to bedek habayith (Temple maintenance)], then he shall redeem it according to the valuation [i.e., according to the Cohein's assessment], and he shall add its fifth upon it. And if it is not redeemed [by the owner], then it shall be sold by the valuation [to others].
27:28	[There are two possible readings for this verse, one, (28a) according to those who hold that unspecified devotions (stam charamim) go to the Cohanim; the other, (28b) according to those who hold that they go to hekdesh (Temple maintenance)]
		(27:28a):	But every [unspecified] devotion (cherem) which a man shall devote to the L rd of all that he has, of man [i.e., Canaanite bondsmen or bondswomen] and beast, and field of holding shall not be sold, and they shall not be redeemed, [but they shall be given to the Cohein]. Every cherem of holy of holies is to the L rd [i.e., charamim that go to the Cohein "take" on (animals that have been made) holy of holies (as well as on lower-order offerings). In the instance of a vow (neder, see 22:17), he gives its (the animal's) money value (to the Cohein); in the instance of a gift (nedavah, see Ibid.), he gives him (the value of) the "benefit" (of giving it to the Cohein of his choice)].
		(27:28b):	But every cherem which a man shall devote to the L rd [i.e., which he shall expressly devote to the Cohanim] of all that he has, of man and beast, and field of holding shall not be sold, and they shall not be redeemed, [all agreeing that charamim to the Cohanim cannot be redeemed until they reach the hand of the Cohein (and that charamim to hekdesh can be redeemed)]; every [unspecified] cherem is holy of holies to the L rd [i.e., to hekdesh].
27:29	Any cherem that is devoted from a man [i.e., from a man going out to be executed (an observer saying: "I vow to give the valuation of that man")] shall not be redeemed, [for] he is going to be put to death [(and has no valuation)].
27:30	And all the tithe of the land [second-tithe (ma'aser sheni)], of the seed of the land [i.e., grain], of the fruit of the tree [wine and oil], belong to the L rd [and He has commanded you (Deuteronomy 14:23) to go up and eat it "from His table" in Jerusalem]; it is holy to the L rd.
27:31	And if a man would redeem of his tithe [to permit him to eat it anywhere, (and with the redemption money he buys food in Jerusalem, which he eats there)], then he shall add its fifth upon it [(but if he redeems his neighbor's tithe, he need not add a fifth)].
27:32	And all the tithe of herd or flock, whatever passes under the staff [(He would strike every tenth animal (passing in a row) with a staff painted red)], the tenth shall be holy to the L rd [(The blood and eimurin are offered on the altar, and the flesh is eaten by the owner)].
27:33	He shall not discriminate (in tithing) between good [unblemished] or bad [blemished. (Not that he sacrifices a blemished animal, but that he eats it in the status of ma'aser, and it is forbidden to shear it or work it)]; nor shall he substitute (another animal) for it — and if he did substitute for it, then it and its substitute shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
27:34	These are the mitzvoth which the L rd charged Moses to (command to) the children of Israel on Mount Sinai.

 
Bamidbar
1
1:1	And the L rd said to Moses in the desert of Sinai in the tent of meeting on the first day of the second month (Iyyar) in the second year after their going out from the land of Egypt, saying:
1:2	Take the count of the entire congregation of the children of Israel by their families [to know the number of each tribe], by their fathers' house [(one whose father is of one tribe and his mother of a different tribe being reckoned by the tribe of his father)], according to the number of names, every male by their heads [a beka (half a shekel) for a head (Exodus 38:26)].
1:3	From twenty years and up, all who go to war in Israel, [twenty being the minimum age], number them by their hosts, you and Aaron.
1:4	And with you shall be [when you count them] one man of every tribe, each the chief of his fathers' house.
1:5	And these are the names of the men who will stand with you: Of Reuven — Elitzur ben Shedeur.
1:6	Of Shimon — Shelumiel ben Tzurishadai.
1:7	Of Yehudah — Nachshon ben Aminadav.
1:8	Of Yissachar — Nethanel ben Tzuar.

1:16	These are the "called" of the congregation, [so called because they were called upon for every matter of importance affecting the congregation], the chiefs of the tribes of their fathers. The heads of the thousands of Israel (were) they.
1:17	And Moses and Aaron took these men that were designated [here to Moses] by name.
1:18	And they assembled the entire congregation on the first (day) of the second month, and they confirmed their birth (claims) [with deeds and witnesses] after their families, by their fathers' house, according to the number of names, (every male) from twenty years and up, by their heads [see 1].
1:19	As the L rd commanded Moses — and he numbered them in the desert of Sinai.
1:20	And the children of Reuven, the first-born of Israel, were — their births, by their families, by their fathers' house, according to the number of names, by their heads, every male from twenty years and up, all who go to war —
1:21	Their number of the tribe of Reuven — forty-six thousand and five hundred.
1:22	Of the children of Shimon, their births by their families by their fathers' house, their number according to the number of names, by their heads, every male from twenty years and up, all who go to war —
1:23	Their number of the tribe of Shimon — fifty-nine thousand and three hundred.

1:29	Their number of the tribe of Yissachar — fifty-four thousand and four hundred.
1:30	Of the children of Zevulun, their births by their families by their fathers' house, according to the number of names, from twenty years and up, all who go to war —
1:31	Their number of the tribe of Zevulun — fifty-seven thousand and four hundred.
1:32	Of the children of Joseph: Of the children of Ephraim, their births by their families by their fathers' house, according to the number of names, from twenty years and up, all who go to war —
1:33	Their number of the tribe of Ephraim — forty thousand and five hundred.
1:34	Of the children of Menasheh, their births by their families by their fathers' house, according to the number of names, from twenty years and up, all who go to war —
1:35	Their number of the tribe of Menasheh — thirty-two thousand and two hundred.
1:36	Of the children of Binyamin, their births by their families by their fathers' house, according to the number of names, from twenty years and up, all who go to war —
1:37	Their number of the tribe of Binyamin — thirty-five thousand and four hundred.
1:38	Of the children of Dan, their births by their families by their fathers' house, according to the number of names, from twenty years and up, all who go to war —
1:39	Their number of the tribe of Dan — sixty-two thousand and seven hundred.
1:40	Of the children of Asher, their births by their families by their fathers' house, according to the number of names, from twenty years and up, all who go to war —
1:41	Their number of the tribe of Asher — forty-one thousand and five hundred.
1:42	The children of Naftali, their births by their families by their fathers' house, according to the number of names, from twenty years and up, all who go to war —
1:43	Their number of the tribe of Naftali — fifty-three thousand and four hundred.
1:44	These are the numbered, who were numbered by Moses and Aaron and the chiefs of Israel, twelve men; one man for his fathers' house were they.
1:45	And they were — all that were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers' house, from twenty years and up, all who go to war in Israel —
1:46	All those numbered were six hundred and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.
1:47	But the Levites, after the tribe of their fathers, were not numbered among them.
1:48	And the L rd said to Moses, saying:
1:49	Only the tribe of Levi do not number, and do not take their count in the midst of the children of Israel [The "King's legion" merits an independent count.]
1:50	And you, appoint the Levites over the mishkan of the Testimony, and over all of its vessels, and over all that pertains to it. They shall bear the mishkan and all of its vessels, and they shall minister to it, and roundabout the mishkan shall they camp.
1:51	And when the mishkan travels, the Levites shall dismantle it [and carry it to the place where the cloud (preceding them) comes to rest], and when the mishkan rests, the Levites shall raise it. And the stranger that draws near [to this service of the Levites] shall be put to death [at the hands of Heaven].
1:52	And the children of Israel shall encamp, every man in his own camp and every man by his standard, [as per the arrangement of the standards (below), three tribes to each standard], according to their hosts.
1:53	And the Levites shall encamp around the mishkan of the Testimony and there shall be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel [if you follow these directives; but if not — if strangers appropriate this service, then there will be wrath (as in the instance of Korach, 17:11)], and the Levites shall keep the charge of the mishkan of the Testimony.
1:54	And the children of Israel did according to all that the L rd commanded Moses; thus did they do.
2
2:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying:
2:2	Every man by his standard, with signs according to their fathers' house shall the children of Israel camp. [(On each standard there were colored cloths corresponding to the respective colors of the stones of the tribes on the choshen, by which every man could identify his standard)]. Opposite, [the distance of a mil (two thousand cubits, the permitted Sabbath distance — see Joshua 3:4), so that they could come (there) on Sabbath, Moses, Aaron and his sons, and the Levites encamping nearby], roundabout the tent of meeting shall they camp.
2:3	And those who encamped in front, in the east — the standard of the camp of Yehudah according to their hosts. And the chief of the children of Yehudah, Nachshon ben Aminadav.
2:4	And his host and their numbered ones, seventy-four thousand and six hundred.
2:5	And encamped next to him, the tribe of Yissachar; and the chief of the children of Yissachar, Nethanel ben Tzuar.
2:6	And his host and their numbered ones, fifty-four thousand and four hundred.
2:7	The tribe of Zevulun; and the chief of the children of Zevulun, Eliyav ben Cheilon.
2:8	And his host and their numbered ones, fifty-seven thousand and four hundred.
2:9	All of the numbered of the camp of Yehudah — one hundred and eighty-six thousand and four hundred, according to their hosts; first shall they travel. [When they saw the cloud departing, the Cohanim sounded the trumpets, and the camp of Yehudah traveled first. (And they traveled in the order of their encampment: the Levites and the wagons in the center, the standard of Yehudah on the east; that of Reuven, on the south; that of Ephraim, on the west; that of Dan, on the north.)]
2:10	The standard of the camp of Reuven, on the south, according to their hosts; and the chief of the children of Reuven, Elitzur ben Shedeur.
2:11	And his host and their numbered ones, forty-six thousand and five hundred.
2:12	And encamped next to him, the tribe of Shimon; and the chief of the children of Shimon, Shlumiel ben Tzurishadai.
2:13	And his host and their numbered ones, fifty-nine thousand and three hundred.
2:14	And the tribe of Gad; and the chief of the children of Gad, Elyasaf ben Re'uel.
2:15	And his host and their numbered ones, forty-five thousand and six hundred and fifty.
2:16	All of the numbered of the camp of Reuven, one hundred and fifty-one thousand and four hundred and fifty, according to their hosts; and they shall travel second.
2:17	And the tent of meeting shall travel [after these two standards] with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps. As they encamp [i.e., in the same directions in which they are positioned], so do they travel [see 2:9], each man in his place, by their standards.
2:18	The standard of the camp of Ephraim, according to their hosts, on the west; and the chief of the children of Ephraim, Elishama ben Amihud.
2:19	And his host and their numbered ones, forty thousand and five hundred.
2:20	And next to him, the tribe of Menasheh; and the chief of the children of Menasheh, Gamliel ben Pedatzur.
2:21	And his host and their numbered ones, thirty-two thousand and two hundred.
2:22	And the tribe of Binyamin; and the chief of the children of Binyamin, Avidan ben Gidoni.
2:23	And his host and their numbered ones, thirty-five thousand and four hundred.
2:24	All of the numbered of the camp of Ephraim, one hundred and eight thousand and one hundred, according to their hosts; and they shall travel third.
2:25	The standard of the camp of Dan, on the north, according to their hosts; and the chief of the children of Dan, Achiezer ben Amishadai.
2:26	And his host and their numbered ones, sixty-two thousand and seven hundred.
2:27	And encamped next to him, the tribe of Asher; and the chief of the children of Asher, Pagiel ben Achran.
2:28	And his host and their numbered ones, forty-one thousand and five hundred.
2:29	And the tribe of Naftali; and the chief of the children of Naftali, Achira ben Einan.
2:30	And his host and their numbered ones, fifty-three thousand and four hundred.
2:31	All of the numbered of the camp of Dan, one hundred and fifty-seven thousand and six hundred; last shall they travel, by their standards.
2:32	These are the numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers' house, all the numbered of the camps according to their hosts — six hundred and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.
2:33	And the Levites were not counted in the midst of the children of Israel, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
2:34	And the children of Israel did according to all that the L rd had commanded Moses. Thus did they encamp by their standards, and thus did they travel, each according to his families, by his fathers' house.
3
3:1	And these are the generations of Aaron and Moses [(Even though only the sons of Aaron are mentioned, they are called "the generations of Moses" because he taught them Torah (whence it is derived that if one teaches his friend's son Torah, it is as if he had begotten him)], on the day the L rd spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai [i.e., on that day they became his "generations," for he taught them what he had learned from the Almighty.]
3:2	And these are the names of the sons of Aaron: the first-born — Nadav; and Avihu, Elazar, and Ithamar.
3:3	These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed Cohanim, whom he invested to minister.
3:4	And Nadav and Avihu died before the L rd when they presented a strange fire before the L rd in the desert of Sinai, and they had no sons. And Elazar and Ithamar ministered in the presence [i.e., in the lifetime] of Aaron their father.
3:5	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
3:6	Bring near the tribe of Levi and place them before Aaron the Cohein, that they serve him.
3:7	[And what is this service?] They shall keep his charge [that no stranger come near (to the holy things; the Levites assisted him in this)] and the charge of the entire congregation before the tent of meeting to perform the service of the mishkan.
3:8	And they shall guard all the vessels of the tent of meeting and (they shall keep) the charge of the children of Israel to perform the service of the mishkan. [The service of the mishkan devolved upon all of Israel, and the Levites became their emissaries for it (in payment for which they give the tithe to the Levites)].
3:9	And you shall give the Levites to Aaron and to his sons. They are given to him [i.e., separated unto him by the L rd's decree] from the [midst of the] children of Israel.
3:10	And Aaron and his sons shall you charge that they guard their priesthood [(receiving the blood, sprinkling, smoking, and the services relegated to the priests)], and the stranger that draws near shall be put to death.
3:11	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
3:12	And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from the midst of the children of Israel, [that the Israelites hire them for My service. And whence comes this "prerogative" of Mine?] In place of every first-born, opener of the womb, of the children of Israel, [i.e., The service originally devolved upon the first-born, and when they sinned with the golden calf, the Levites, who did not sin, were selected in their place.] And the Levites shall be Mine.
3:13	For Mine is every first-born. On the day I smote every first-born in the land of Egypt, I sanctified unto Me every first-born in Israel, from man until beast. Mine shall they be — I am the L rd.
3:14	And the L rd spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai, saying:
3:15	Number the children of Levi, by their fathers' house, by their families. Every male, from one month and above [(after they have left the category of nefalim (non-viable births)] shall you number them. [He is numbered to be called "a keeper of the charge of the sanctuary" (3:28). (The Levites are "conversant" in being numbered from the womb, e.g., Yocheved, the daughter of Levi (see 26:59)].
3:16	And Moses numbered them by word of the L rd as he had been commanded. [A heavenly voice would come to Moses from the door of each tent, saying: So many and so many infants are in this tent.]
3:17	And these were the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, Kehath, and Merari.
3:18	And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Livni and Shimi.
3:19	And the sons of Kehath by their families: Amram and Yitzhar, Chevron and Uziel.
3:20	And the sons of Merari by their families: Machli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites by their fathers' house.
3:21	Unto Gershon [were numbered] the family of the Livni and the family of the Shimi. These are the families of the Gershuni.
3:22	Their numbered, the number of all the males from one month and above: seven thousand and five hundred.
3:23	The families of the Gershuni were to encamp behind the mishkan, on the west.
3:24	And the chief of the fathers' house of the Gershuni, Elyasaf ben La'el.
3:25	And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting: the mishkan [the lower curtains] and the tent [the goats' hair curtains, which served as a roof], its covering [the hides of the rams and the techashim] and the partition for the door of the tent of meeting [the vilon].
3:26	And the hangings of the court, and the partition for the door of the court, which is by the mishkan and by the altar roundabout, and its cords [(those of the mishkan and of the tent, but not those of the court)], for all of its service.
3:27	And unto Kehath [were numbered] the family of the Amrami, and the family of the Yitzhari, and the family of the Chevroni, and the family of the Azieli. These are the families of the Kehathi.
3:28	The number of all the males from one month and above: eight thousand and six hundred, keepers of the charge of the sanctuary.
3:29	The families of the sons of Kehath were to encamp at the side of the mishkan on the south.
3:30	And the chief of the fathers' house of the families of the Kehathi, Elitzafan ben Uziel.
3:31	And their charge: the ark and the table and the menorah and the altars, and the ministering vessels of the sanctuary, and the partition (masach) [the parocheth, which is also called "parocheth hamasach" (Exodus 35:52)], and all of its service.
3:32	And the chief of the chiefs of the Levites, Elazar the son of Aaron the Cohein, [this charge being] the appointment of the keepers of the sanctuary.
3:33	Unto Merari [were numbered] the family of the Machli, and the family of the Mushi. These are the families of Merari.
3:34	And their numbered, the number of all the males from one month and above, six thousand and two hundred.
3:35	And the chief of the father's house of the families of Merari, Tzuriyel ben Avichayil. At the side of the mishkan they were to encamp, on the north.
3:26	And the appointed charge of the sons of Merari: the beams of the mishkan and its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets, and all of its vessels, and all of its service.
3:37	And the pillars of the court roundabout, and their sockets, and their pegs, and their cords.
3:38	And those who encamped before the mishkan, in front, before the tent of meeting, on the east — Moses, and Aaron, and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary, for the charge of the children of Israel [see 8]; and the stranger that draws near shall be put to death.
3:39	All the numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered [(The dots over "Aharon" indicate that he was not included in the count of the Levites)] by word of the L rd, by their families, all the males from one month and above — twenty-two thousand. [(Actually 22,300; but 300 of the Levites were themselves bechoroth (first-born), so that they are not included in the count, which is the number of those Levites who displaced bechoroth (and does not include those who were bechoroth themselves (see 46-48)].
3:40	And the L rd said to Moses: Number all the first-born males of the children of Israel [(after they have left the category of nefalim — see 3:15)], from one month and above, and take the number of their names.
3:41	And you shall take the Levites for Me — I am the L rd — in place of all the first-born of the children of Israel, and the beasts of the Levites in place of all the firstlings of the beasts of the children of Israel.
3:42	And Moses numbered, as the L rd commanded him, all the first-born of the children of Israel.
3:43	And all the male first-born were, by number of names, from one month and above, of those that were numbered — twenty-two thousand and two hundred and seventy-three.
3:44	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
3:45	Take the Levites in place of all the first-born of the children of Israel, and the beasts of the Levites in place of their beasts, [the firstling of asses (One lamb of a Levite would redeem many ass-firstlings of Israelites)], and the Levites shall be Mine — I am the L rd.
3:46	And (for) the redemption (money) of the two hundred and seventy-three of the bechoroth of the children of Israel over and above the (number of the) Levites,
3:47	You shall take five shekels for a head. By the shekel of the sanctuary shall you take it, twenty gerah to the shekel.
3:48	And you shall give the money to Aaron and to his sons, the redemption (money) of the excess of them [the bechoroth, over the Levites].
3:49	And Moses took the redemption money from those (bechoroth) who exceeded the (bechoroth) redeemed [bodily] by the Levites.
3:50	[By ballot] from [two hundred and seventy-three] bechoroth of the children of Israel, he took the money — one thousand and three hundred and sixty-five (shekels) by the shekel of the sanctuary.
3:51	And Moses gave the money of the redeemed to Aaron and to his sons by the word of the L rd, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
4
4:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying:
4:2	Take the count of the sons of Kehath [of those fit for carrying (i.e., from the age of thirty to fifty)], from the midst of the sons of Levi, by their families, by their fathers' house.
4:3	From thirty years and up until fifty years, all who enter into service, to do work in the tent of meeting.
4:4	This is the service of the sons of Kehath in the tent of meeting, holy of holies, [i.e., the holiest of all: the ark, the table, the menorah, the altars, the parocheth, and the ministering vessels.]
4:5	And Aaron and his sons shall come, when the camp is to travel [(being apprised of this by the departure of the cloud)], and they shall take down the parocheth partition and cover therewith the ark of the Testimony. [They placed each article in its designated sheath and the sons of Kehath needed only to carry it.]
4:6	And they shall put thereon a covering of tachash skin, and they shall spread a cloth all of blue over it, and they shall place its staves.
4:7	And on the show (-bread) table shall they spread a cloth of blue, and they shall place thereon the [bread-] molds, the censers, the staves, and the canes for covering [see Exodus 25:29]; and the continual bread shall be thereon.
4:8	And they shall spread thereon a cloth of scarlet and cover it with a tachash skin covering, and they shall place its staves.
4:9	And they shall take a blue cloth and cover the menorah of lighting and its lamps, and its tongs, and its snuff-dishes [see Exodus 25:32] and all its oil vessels wherewith they minister unto it.
4:10	And they shall place it and all of its vessels into a covering of tachash skin [a kind of sack] and put it on a bar.
4:11	And on the golden altar they shall spread a blue cloth and cover it with a tachash skin covering, and they shall place its staves.
4:12	And they shall take all the ministering vessels with which they minister in the sanctuary [i.e., the incense vessels with which they minister on the inner altar] and put them in a blue cloth and cover them with a tachash skin covering and put them on a bar.
4:13	And they shall remove the ashes from the [copper] altar, and spread upon it a purple cloth.
4:14	And they shall place on it all of its implements wherewith they minister upon it: its fire-pans, its spits, its shovels, and its sprinkling basins [see Exodus 27:3] — all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a tachash skin covering, and they shall place its staves.
4:15	And Aaron and his sons shall finish covering the holy (things) [the ark and the altar] and all the holy vessels when the camp is to travel, and then the sons of Kehath shall come to carry (them), and they shall not touch the holy (things) lest they die [(at the hands of Heaven)]. These (things) are the burden of the sons of Kehath in the tent of meeting.
4:16	And the charge of Elazar the son of Aaron the Cohein was [the carrying of] the oil for lighting, and the spice incense, and the continual meal-offering [(He was charged with commanding and expediting its offering upon encampment)], and the anointing oil. [And, in addition, he was appointed over the burden of the sons of Kehath, to assign to each his service and his burden, viz.] the charge of all the mishkan and all that was in it, the holy (things) and all of its vessels [(as set forth above)].
4:17	And the L rd spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying:
4:18	Do not cut off the tribe of the families of the Kehathi from the midst of the Levites [i.e., take care not to bring about their death].
4:19	But do this for them and they will live and not die when they approach the holy of holies: Aaron and his sons shall come and set them, each man to his service and to his burden.
4:20	And they shall not come to see when the holy (things) are being covered [within their sheath (5)] and die.
Nasso
4:21	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
4:22	Take the count of the sons of Gershon, they too, [as I commanded you in respect to the sons of Kehath, to see how many of them qualify for service], by their fathers' houses, by their families.
4:23	From thirty years and up until fifty years, all who enter into service, to serve in the tent of meeting.
4:24	This is the service of the families of the Gershuni for service and for burden.
4:25	They shall bear the curtains of the mishkan [the ten lower ones] and of the tent of meeting [the goats' hair curtains which tented it], its covering [the rams' skins dyed red] and the tachash covering that is on it from above, and the partition for the door of the tent of meeting [i.e., the eastern curtain].
4:26	And the curtains of the court, and the partition for the door of the gate of the court which shield the mishkan and the [copper] altar roundabout, and their cords, and all their service implements, and all that is relegated to them [the sons of Gershon] that they may serve.
4:27	By word of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershuni for all of their burdens and for all of their service. And you shall designate unto them the charge of all their burdens.
4:28	This is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershuni in the tent of meeting. And their charge shall be by the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the Cohein.
4:29	The sons of Merari — by their families, by their fathers' house shall you number them.
4:30	From thirty years and up until fifty years shall you number them, all who enter into service, to perform the service of the tent of meeting.
4:31	And this is the charge of their burden for all of their service in the tent of meeting: the beams of the mishkan and its bars, and its pillars and its sockets.
4:32	And the pillars of the court roundabout, and their [the pillars'] pins and cords [for hanging of the curtains on the pillars], with all of their implements for all of their service. And by name shall you reckon the implements of the charge of their bearing.
4:33	This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari for all of their service in the tent of meeting by the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the Cohein.
4:34	And Moses and Aaron and the chiefs of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kehathi by their families and by their fathers' house.
4:35	From thirty years and up until fifty years, all who entered the service for service in the tent of meeting.
4:36	And their numbered ones by their families were two thousand and seven hundred and fifty.
4:37	These are the numbered of the families of the Kehathi, all who serve in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered by word of the L rd by the hand of Moses.
4:38	And the numbered ones of the sons of Gershon by their families and by their fathers' house,
4:39	From thirty years and up until fifty years, all who entered the service, for service in the tent of meeting.
4:40	Their numbered ones by their families by their fathers' house were two thousand and six hundred and thirty.
4:41	These are the numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon, all who serve in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered by word of the L rd.
4:42	And the numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, by their families by their fathers' house,
4:43	From thirty years and up until fifty years, all who entered the service, for service in the tent of meeting.
4:44	Their numbered ones by their families were three thousand and two hundred.
4:45	These are the numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered by word of the L rd by the hand of Moses.
4:46	All the numbered ones, whom Moses and Aaron and all the chiefs of Israel numbered of the Levites by their families and by their fathers' house.
4:47	From thirty years and up until fifty years, all who entered to serve — the service [of song, with cymbals and lutes,] of [i.e., on behalf of] service [the sacrificial service] and the service of bearing in the tent of meeting.
4:48	Their numbered ones were eight thousand and five hundred and eighty.
4:49	By word of the L rd did he count them, by the hand of Moses, each for his service and for his burden. And their numbered ones were as the L rd had commanded Moses [i.e., from thirty years and up until fifty].
5
5:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
5:2	Command the children of Israel [(This section was stated on the day that the mishkan was erected)] that they send out of the camp [(There were three camps: the camp of the Shechinah — within the curtains (of the mishkan); the camp of the Levites — the encampment of the Levites roundabout (the mishkan); the camp of Israel — from the camp of the Levites until the end of the encampment of the standards on all four sides)] every leper, [to be sent out of all three camps)], every zav [to be sent out of the first two camps (see Leviticus 15:2)] and everyone who has become unclean by a dead body [to be sent out only from the first camp].
5:3	From male until female shall you send them out. Outside of the camp shall you send them; and they shall not make unclean their camps in whose midst I dwell.
5:4	And the children of Israel did so, and they sent them outside the camp. As the L rd spoke to Moses, so did the children of Israel do.
5:5	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
5:6	Speak to the children of Israel: A man or a woman, if they do of all the sins of man to commit a profanation against the L rd [and swear falsely in denial of a claim], and that soul be guilty, [(Although this has already been stated (Leviticus 5:21), it is repeated here for two new teachings: First (7) that one is not liable for the fifth and the guilt-offering by the testimony of witnesses, but only by his own confession; second (8) that the stolen property of a proselyte (without heirs) is given to the Cohanim)],
5:7	And they confess their sins which they have done, then he shall make restitution for his guilt by (restoration of) its (the theft's) principal, and its fifth shall he add to it, and he shall give it to the one to whom he is liable [for payment].
5:8	And if the man does not have a redeemer to whom to return the debt, [the claimant, a proselyte, having died and left no heirs], the debt [the principal], which is returned [i.e., "and the fifth"] is the L rd's [i.e., He has acquired it, and He has given it] to the Cohein [of the officiating watch], aside from the ram of atonement whereby atonement shall be made for him.
5:9	And every terumah of all the holy things of the children of Israel which they present to the Cohein [i.e., bikkurim (first-fruits)], to him shall it be.
5:10	And every man, his holy things, to him shall they be [i.e., he has the privilege of giving them to whichever Cohein he wishes.] Whatever [designated gifts] a man gives to the Cohein, to him shall it be [i.e., it shall redound to the giver's wealth.]
5:11	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
5:12	Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: A man, if his wife go astray, and she be faithless to him,
5:13	And [(the faithlessness being that)] a man [(excluding a minor or an animal)] lie with her a lying of seed, and it be hid [(but if he saw and made himself "unseeing," the waters do not probe her)] from the eyes [(excluding a blind man)] of her husband, and she had secreted herself [with him long enough for intercourse], and she be defiled, and there be no witness to it [to the act of intercourse (for if there were even one witness to the act, the draught is not administered to her), but there be witnesses to her having secreted herself with him], and she had not been seized [i.e., forced],
5:14	And [before she had secreted herself] there had passed over him a spirit of rancor and he had warned his wife [not to secrete herself with that man], and she were defiled [i.e., she might have been defiled] — Or, there had passed over him a spirit of rancor and he had warned his wife [and she had transgressed his warning (and secreted herself)] and she were not defiled [i.e., it is not known whether she were or were not defiled],
5:15	Then the man shall bring his wife to the Cohein, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth of an ephah of meal [(not fine flour)] of barley [(not wheat, the offering for a "beastly" act being the food of a beast)]. He shall not pour oil upon it, [so that her offering not be beautified], and he shall not place frankincense upon it, for it is a meal-offering of rancors [the L rd's and her husband's], a meal-offering of memorial, a reminder of sin.
5:16	And the Cohein shall draw her near and stand her before the L rd [at the gate of Nikanor, the eastern gate, where all entered.]
5:17	And the Cohein shall take water consecrated [in the laver] in an earthen vessel. And of the dust that is on the floor of the mishkan shall the Cohein take and place it in the water.
5:18	And the Cohein shall stand the woman before the L rd [again (see 16). (They would walk her from place to place to "weary" her into confession)]; and he shall dishevel the hair of the woman [in order to shame her], and he shall place in her hands the meal-offering of memorial, [to "weary" her into confession so that the Tetragrammaton not be erased in the waters] — it is a meal-offering of rancors — and in the hand of the Cohein will be the bitter [(causing her a "bitter" end)] blighting waters [("blighting" her from the world)].
5:19	And the Cohein shall beswear her and he shall say to the woman: If no man has lain with you, and you have not strayed uncleanly from your husband, then be clean (hinaki) of these bitter, blighting waters.
5:20	And you, if you have gone astray from your husband, and if you have become unclean, and a man has put his lying in you aside from your husband, [then chinaki ("be strangled")].
5:21	Then the Cohein shall beswear the woman with the oath of the curse, and the Cohein shall say to the woman: May the L rd render you a curse [(that all curse by you, viz.: "May it happen to you as happened to that woman, etc.")] and an oath [(that all swear by you, viz.: "If I have not spoken truly may it happen to me, etc.")] in the midst of your people by the L rd's causing your thigh to fall and your belly to swell [("thigh" precedes "belly" in the curse as it did in the act)].
5:22	And these blighting waters shall enter your innards to swell the belly and to make fall the thigh [of the adulterer (as well)], and the woman shall say: Amen, Amen [(Amen to the curse, Amen to the oath; Amen, in respect to this man, Amen in respect to any other man; Amen, that I did not go astray while betrothed, married, awaiting levirate marriage, or having been taken in levirate marriage.)]
5:23	Then the Cohein shall write these curses into a scroll and erase into the bitter waters.
5:24	And when he makes the woman drink the bitter, blighting waters, then the blighting waters shall enter into [all of] her, [(and not only into "thigh and belly," those being singled out because they "initiated" the transgression)] for bitterness [i.e., to be sore and bitter to her].
5:25	And the Cohein shall take from the hand of the woman the meal-offering of rancors, and he shall wave the meal-offering before the L rd [back and forth and up and down. And she waves it with him, her hand above that of the Cohein], and he shall present it at the [south-west corner of the] altar [before taking the fistful, as with the other meal-offerings].
5:26	And the Cohein shall take a fistful from the meal-offering as its "remembrance" [see Leviticus 2:2], and he shall smoke it on the altar, and then he shall make the woman drink the water.
5:27	And he shall make her drink the water [(to include an instance where she refused to drink after the scroll was blotted out; in which instance she is forcibly made to drink it — unless she admitted having been adulterous.)] And it shall be, if she had been defiled and had been faithless to her husband, then the blighting waters will enter her for bitterness, and her belly will swell and her thigh will fall. [Though in the curses (21) "thigh" precedes "belly," in operation, the waters first enter the belly and then the thigh.] And the woman will be a curse in the midst of her people.
5:28	And if the woman had not been defiled [in this concealment] and she be clean [of any other act], then she shall be absolved [of the blighting waters] and [what is more,] she will sow seed. [If she had difficult labors, she will have easy ones; if she had borne swarthy children, she will bear fair ones.]
5:29	This is the law of the rancors for a woman who goes astray under her husband and is defiled.
5:30	If there pass over a man a spirit of rancor, then he shall warn his wife, and he shall stand his wife before the L rd and the Cohein shall do with her all of this law.
5:31	And the man will be free of sin [i.e., of liability for her death by the waters], and that woman shall bear her sin.
6
6:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
6:2	Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: A man or a woman, if he utter a vow, the vow of a Nazirite [lit., "one who separates himself"] to separate himself [from wine] unto the L rd [i.e., for the sake of Heaven], [(The rationale of the juxtaposition of verses — "All who witness a sotah (a woman suspected of infidelity) in her undoing should separate themselves from wine," wine inciting to licentiousness)],
6:3	From [new] wine and shechar [old (lit., "intoxicating") wine] he shall separate himself. Vinegar of wine and vinegar of shechar he shall not drink; and any steeping of grapes he shall not drink, and grapes, wet or dry, he shall not eat.
6:4	All the days of his Naziritism, of all that is made from the grapevine, from the kernels to the husk, he shall not eat.
6:5	All the days of the vow of his Naziritism a blade shall not pass over his head. Until the fulfillment of the days of his Naziritism to the L rd, holy shall it [his hair] be [by his] letting grow long the growth [pera ("pera" is not less than thirty days)] of the hair of his head.
6:6	All the days of his Naziritism to the L rd, by a dead body he shall not come.
6:7	For his father and for his mother, for his brother and for his sister, he shall not make himself unclean for them in their death, for the crown of his G d is on his head.
6:8	All the days of his Naziritism, holy is he to the L rd [("holiness" of body — not making himself unclean for the dead)].
6:9	And if any man die on him [in the tent where he finds himself], of an instant, unexpectedly, and he make unclean the head of his Naziritism, then he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing [i.e., sprinkling (of the waters of the red heifer, 19:17)]; on the seventh day shall he shave it.
6:10	And on the eighth day [i.e., from the eighth day on], he shall bring two turtle-doves or two young pigeons to the Cohein, to the door of the tent of meeting.
6:11	And the Cohein shall offer one as a sin-offering and one as a burnt-offering, and he shall atone for him for having sinned through the (dead) body, and he shall hallow his head on that day [i.e., He shall begin again the count of his Naziritism].
6:12	And he shall consecrate [anew] to the L rd the days of his Naziritism, and he shall bring a lamb of the first year as a guilt-offering, and the first days shall fall off [from the count] because he made unclean his Naziritism.
6:13	And this is the law of the Nazirite. On the day of the fulfillment of the days of his Naziritism, he shall bring himself to the door of the tent of meeting.
6:14	And he shall offer up his sacrifice to the L rd: one lamb of the first year without blemish as a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb of the first year without blemish as a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish as a peace-offering.
6:15	And a basket of unleavened bread of fine flour, [ten] cakes [of unleavened bread] mixed with oil, and [ten] wafers of unleavened bread smeared with oil, and their [the burnt-offering's and the peace-offering's] meal-offering and their drink-offerings.
6:16	And the Cohein shall present (them) before the L rd, and he shall offer his sin-offering and his burnt-offering.
6:17	And the ram shall he offer as a sacrifice of peace-offerings to the L rd for the basket of unleavened bread [i.e., he shall slaughter the peace-offerings with the intent of consecrating the bread], and the Cohein shall offer its [the ram's] meal-offering and its drink-offering.
6:18	And the Nazirite shall shave — [outside the azarah, after the slaughtering of the peace-offerings, which took place] at the door of the tent of meeting — the head of his Naziritism. And he shall take the hair of the head of his Naziritism, and he shall place it on the fire under the sacrifice of the peace-offerings [i.e., under the cauldron (in the azarah) in which they are cooked (the Cohein being required to take the shoulder after it has been cooked and wave it before the L rd)].
6:19	And the Cohein shall take the cooked shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake from the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and he shall place them on the palms of the Nazirite after his shaving of (the head of) his Naziritism.
6:20	And the Cohein shall wave them, a waving before the L rd. It [(the cake, the wafer, and the shoulder)] is holy [i.e., terumah] to the Cohein, in addition to the breast of waving and the thigh of lifting, [which revert to the Cohein from all peace-offerings], and thereafter the Nazirite may drink wine.
6:21	This is the law of the Nazirite who shall vow his offering to the L rd for his Naziritism, aside from what his hand attains [i.e., if he vows more than the prescribed number of offerings, he must bring them.] According to the vow that he vows, thus shall he do above [(but not below)] the law of his Naziriteship [i.e., the prescribed number of offerings].
6:22	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
6:23	Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying: Thus shall you bless the children of Israel, saying [with full intent and with a whole heart] unto them, [so that they all hear]:
6:24	The L rd bless you [that your possessions increase] and keep you [that you not be despoiled of your possessions].
6:25	The L rd cause His countenance to shine upon you and grant you favor.
6:26	The L rd lift His countenance [i.e., quell His anger] unto you and grant you peace.
6:27	And they shall place My name [the Tetragrammaton] on the children of Israel, and I will bless them [i.e., I will "concur" in their blessing.]

7:1	And it was, on the day that Moses had finished (kalloth) setting up the mishkan and had anointed it and consecrated it and all of its vessels, and (he had set up) the altar and all of its vessels, and had anointed them and consecrated them, [(kalloth): On the day of the setting up of the mishkan, Israel was like a bride (kallah) entering the bridal canopy. ("that Moses had finished"): Although Betzalel and other craftsmen had made the mishkan, it is attributed to Moses for having given heart and soul to see to it that the last detail was executed exactly as the L rd had revealed it to him on Mount Sinai. ("on the day that Moses had finished setting up"): All of the seven days of the investiture, Moses would assemble and dismantle the mishkan, and it was on the eighth day that he assembled it and did not dismantle it. ("On the day that Moses had finished setting up the mishkan"): It was Rosh Chodesh Nissan. On the second (of Nissan) the red heifer was burned; on the third, the first sprinkling (of the cleansing waters) took place, and on the seventh day (the Levites) shaved (see 8:6)],
7:2	That the chiefs of Israel, the heads of their fathers' house, the chiefs of the tribes, [who were their overseers in Egypt, and who were smitten because of them (Exodus 5:14)], they who stood [with Moses and Aaron] over the ones who were numbered [(1:4)], presented (their offerings).
7:3	And they brought their offerings before the L rd, six covered wagons and twelve oxen, a wagon for every two chiefs, and an ox for each, and they presented them before the mishkan [(Moses did not take it from their hands until the L rd told him to do so)].
7:4	And the L rd said to Moses, saying:
7:5	Take it from them, and they shall be for the service of the tent of meeting, and give them to the Levites, each according to his service.
7:6	And Moses took the wagons and the oxen and he gave them to the Levites.
7:7	Two wagons and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service, [which was lighter than that of Merari, who carried the beams, and the pillars, and the sockets].
7:8	And four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the Cohein.
7:9	And to the sons of Kehath he gave none, for the burden of the holy things [the ark, the table, etc.] was theirs, [wherefore] they were to be borne upon the shoulder.
7:10	And the chiefs presented the inauguration (offerings) of the altar on the day it was anointed [(After they had donated the wagons and the oxen for bearing the wagons, their hearts moved them to donate offerings for the inauguration of the altar)], and the chiefs presented their offerings before the altar. [Moses did not take them from their hands until the L rd told him to do so.]
7:11	And the L rd said to Moses: Each chief on his day, each chief on his day, shall present his offerings for the inauguration of the altar. [And Moses did not know whether to follow the order of birth or the order of traveling (see section 2), until the L rd told him to follow the order of traveling.]
7:12	And the one who presented his offering on the first day was Nachshon ben Aminadav of the tribe of Judah.
7:13	And his offering was one silver dish weighing one hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels in the shekel of the sanctuary, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a [donative] meal-offering.
7:14	One spoon, [weighing] ten gold [shekels], full of incense [This is the only instance of incense offered by an individual, and on the outer altar — a "one-time ruling"]
7:15	One young bullock ["the choice of the herd"], one ram, one lamb of the first year for a burnt-offering.
7:16	One he-goat for a sin-offering [to atone for (possible) defilement by a "grave in the depths" and for suspicion of uncleanliness].
7:17	And for the sacrifice of the peace-offerings: two oxen, five rams, five he-goats, five lambs of the first year — this is the [(personal, not tribal)] offering of Nachshon ben Aminadav.
7:18	On the second day, Nethanel ben Tzuar, the chief of Yissachar, presented.
7:19	He presented his offering: one silver dish weighing one hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels in the shekel of the sanctuary, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal-offering.

Beha'alothecha
8
8:1	[The L rd, beholding Aaron's distress at his exclusion and that of his tribe from the inauguration of the altar (in contrast to the participation of the chiefs of all the other tribes) said to him: Your share (the kindling of the menorah) is greater than theirs.] And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
8:2	Speak to Aaron and say to him: When you kindle the lamps (of the menorah), towards the face [the central shaft] of the menorah shall the seven lamps light [i.e., shall their light (by manipulation of the wicks) be directed (so that people not say that He needs the menorah for its light)].
8:3	And Aaron did so. He kindled its lamps towards the face of the menorah, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
8:4	And this was the work of the menorah ["this," as pointed out by the L rd to Moses, who had difficulty in visualizing it]: [It was made of one talent of] beaten gold, from its base [the thickest part] until its flower [its most delicate part] — of beaten work. According to the sight that the L rd had shown Moses, so did he make the menorah.
8:5	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
8:6	Take the Levites from the midst of the children of Israel [("Take them" with words, viz.: "Happy are you, who have merited being servants to the L rd!")], and cleanse them.
8:7	And thus shall you do to them to cleanse them: Sprinkle upon them the waters of purification [of the red heifer (for those among them who had become unclean by dead bodies)], and have them pass a blade over all their flesh (i.e., have them shave it), and have them wash their clothes and be clean.
8:8	And they shall take a young bullock, [this, the "burnt-offering" (12), (a communal offering in atonement for idolatry)], with its meal-offering, fine flour mixed with oil; and a second young bullock shall you take for a sin-offering [("second"): Just as a burnt-offering is not eaten, so this sin-offering (as opposed to all other outer-altar sin-offerings) is not to be eaten — a hora'ath sha'ah ("one-time ruling")].
8:9	And you shall present the Levites before the tent of meeting, and you shall assemble the entire congregation of the children of Israel. [Because the Levites are "given" (16) as an expiatory offering in place of them (the first-born of Israel), let them come and stand by their offerings and place their hand upon them (the Levites).]
8:10	And you shall present the Levites before the L rd, and the children of Israel shall place their hands on the Levites.
8:11	And Aaron shall wave the Levites, a waving before the L rd, [just as the guilt-offering of the leper required waving live (Leviticus 14:12)] from the children of Israel, and they shall serve the service of the L rd. [Three "wavings" are mentioned in this section. This first applies to the sons of Kehath, upon whom the service of the holy of holies devolved (i.e., the bearing of the ark, the table, etc.) — thus: "and they shall serve the service of the L rd."]
8:12	And the Levites shall place their hands upon the head of the bullocks, and make the one a sin-offering, and the other, a burnt-offering to the L rd to atone for the Levites.
8:13	And you shall stand the Levites before Aaron and before his sons, and you shall wave them as a wave-offering to the L rd. [This second waving, "to the L rd," applies to the sons of Gershon, who bore the curtains and the hooks, which were visible in the holy of holies.]
8:14	And you shall separate the Levites from the midst of the children of Israel, and the Levites shall be Mine.
8:15	And after that, the Levites shall come in to do the work of the tent of meeting, and you shall cleanse them, and you shall wave them as a wave-offering. [This third waving applies to the sons of Merari (who carried the parts for the tent of meeting. Thus, "wave-offering" (unqualified by "before the L rd" or "to the L rd")].
8:16	For given, given [(given for bearing and given for singing)] are they [the Levites] to Me from the midst of the children of Israel. In place of the opening of every womb, the first-born of all of the children of Israel, have I taken them unto Me.
8:17	For unto Me [by right] were all the first-born of the children of Israel, of man and beast; on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt [and defended them from the plague], I sanctified them [and took them (as servants)] unto Me [ — until they went astray with the golden calf].
8:18	And [now] I have taken the Levites (who did not go astray with the golden calf) in place of all the first-born of the children of Israel.
8:19	And I have given the Levites, given to Aaron and his sons from the midst of the children of Israel, to perform the service of the children of Israel in the tent of meeting and to make atonement for the children of Israel, that there not be a plague among the children of Israel in the drawing near of the children of Israel to the sanctuary [i.e., if they had to draw near, they would die in doing so.]
8:20	And Moses and Aaron and the entire congregation of the children of Israel did with the Levites in accordance with all that the L rd had commanded Moses respecting the Levites; thus did the children of Israel do with them. [Moses presented them, Aaron waved them, and the Israelites placed their hands upon them.]
8:21	And the Levites were cleansed, and they washed their clothes, and Aaron waved them a waving before the L rd, and Aaron atoned for them to cleanse them.
8:22	And after that the Levites came to perform their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron and before his sons. As the L rd commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they do to them [(There was no demurral neither from the doers nor from the subjects.)]
8:23	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
8:24	This is what applies to the Levites ["Years" disqualify them (from service), and not blemishes.] From the age of twenty-five and up shall he come to enter into service to work in the tent of meeting. [He studies the service for five years and begins working at the age of thirty.]
8:25	And from the age of fifty he shall return from the service of the work, and he shall serve [in that capacity (carrying on the shoulder)] no more, [but he returns to closing the gates, singing, and loading wagons].
8:26	And he shall serve with his brothers in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge [i.e., to encamp around the tent of meeting and to assemble and dismantle it in traveling.] But service (as indicated above) shall he not perform. Thus shall you do with the Levites in their watches.
9
9:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai in the second year after their going out from the land of Egypt, in the first month (Nissan), saying: [(Bamidbar begins with the second month (1:1) — whence it is derived that "there is no before and after (i.e., strict chronological sequence) in the Torah." (It does not begin with this section for it is disparaging to Israel that all the forty years that they were in the desert they offered only this one Paschal sacrifice.)]
9:2	The children of Israel shall offer the Pesach in its appointed time, [even on the Sabbath, even in a state of (communal) uncleanliness].
9:3	On the fourteenth day of this month, towards evening shall you offer it, in its appointed time. According to all of its statutes [the mitzvoth relating directly to its body] and according to all its [attendant] ordinances shall you offer it.
9:4	And Moses spoke to the children of Israel to offer the Pesach. [(He exhorted them prior to observance (having already promulgated it to them when he heard it from Sinai)].
9:5	And they offered the Pesach in the first (month) on the fourteenth day of the month, towards evening, in the desert of Sinai. According to all that the L rd had commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel do.
9:6	And there were men who were unclean by the body of a dead man, and they could not offer the Pesach on that day, and they drew near before Moses and Aaron on that day.
9:7	And those men said to him: We are unclean by the body of a dead man. Why should we be held back, not to offer the sacrifice of the L rd in its appointed time, in the midst of the children of Israel?
9:8	And Moses said to them: Stand, and I will hear what the L rd will command concerning you.
9:9	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
9:10	Speak to the children of Israel, saying: A man, if he be unclean by a dead body, or on a distant way [(Not literally "distant"; it is sufficient that he should have been outside the threshold of the azarah all the time of slaughtering.)], of you or of your generations, he shall (yet) offer the Pesach to the L rd.
9:11	In the second month, on the fourteenth day, towards evening shall they offer it; with matzoth and bitter herbs shall they eat it.
9:12	They shall not leave over of it until the morning, and a bone shall they not break in it; according to all the statute of the Pesach shall they offer it.
9:13	And the man who is clean and was not on the way and who failed to offer the Pesach, that soul shall be cut off from his people; for the sacrifice of the L rd he did not offer in its appointed time. That man shall bear his sin.
9:14	And if there live a proselyte among you, and he would offer a Pesach to the L rd, then according to the statute of the Pesach and according to its ordinance, thus shall he do. One statute shall there be for you, both for the proselyte and for the native of the land.
9:15	And on the day that the mishkan was erected, the cloud covered the mishkan [which had been made] as a tent for the [tablets of the] Testimony. And in the evening there would be on the mishkan a semblance of fire until morning.
9:16	So was it always: the cloud covered it, and a semblance of fire at night.
9:17	And when the cloud departed from over the tent, the children of Israel would travel. And in the place where the cloud rested, the children of Israel encamped.
9:18	By word of the L rd the children of Israel traveled [The cloud would fold itself up like a beam over the (encampment of) the children of Judah (by word of the L rd), and did not start moving until Moses said: "Stand, O L rd!" (see 10:35)], and by word of the L rd they encamped. [The cloud would ascend as a pillar over the children of Judah and would not spread out (over the mishkan) until Moses said: "Rest, O L rd, etc." (see 10:36). Thus (23): "By word of the L rd, at the hand of Moses."] All the days that the cloud abode over the mishkan, they camped.
9:19	And when the cloud lingered over the mishkan many days, the children of Israel kept the charge of the L rd and did not travel.
9:20	And at times the cloud remained over the mishkan but a few days. By word of the L rd they encamped, and by word of the L rd they traveled.
9:21	And at times the cloud remained from evening until morning, and when the cloud departed in the morning, they traveled. Or a day or a night — when the cloud departed, they traveled.
9:22	Or two days, or a month, or a year — when the cloud lingered over the mishkan, abiding upon it, the children of Israel remained encamped and did not travel; and when it departed, they traveled.
9:23	By word of the L rd they encamped, and by word of the L rd they traveled. The charge of the L rd they kept — by word of the L rd, at the hand of Moses.
10
10:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
10:2	Make for yourself [i.e., from what is yours] two trumpets of silver; beaten work (from a block of silver) shall you make them. And they shall be for you for convoking the congregation [the Sanhedrin and the rest of the people] and for the [signaling of the] traveling of the camps.
10:3	And when they [the Cohanim] blow [tekiah] with [both of] them, then all the congregation shall gather unto you, to the door of the tent of meeting.
10:4	And if they blow with one, there shall gather unto you [at the door of the tent of meeting], the chiefs, the heads of the thousands of Israel.
10:5	And when you blow a teruah (tremolo), [in sum: tekiah, teruah, tekiah] then there shall travel the eastern encampments.
10:6	And when you blow a second teruah then there shall travel the southern encampments; a teruah shall they blow for their travels.
10:7	And when the assembly is to be gathered you shall blow a tekiah (an extended blast), but not a teruah. [In sum: convoking of the congregation, with two trumpets; convoking of the chiefs, with one. In both instances, no teruah. Traveling of the camps, with two trumpets, teruah and tekiah.]
10:8	And the sons of Aaron the Cohanim shall blow on the trumpets [for these convocations and travels], and they shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations.
10:9	And when you go to war in your land against the oppressor who oppresses you, then you shall sound the trumpets and you will be remembered before the L rd your G d, and you will be saved from your enemies.
10:10	And on the day of your rejoicing and on your appointed times, and on your new moons, you shall sound the trumpets [( — whence is derived "shofar- oth" (on Rosh Hashanah)] over your [communal] burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings. And they shall be to you for a remembrance (zikkaron) [( — whence is derived "zichronoth")] before your G d. I am the L rd your G d [( — whence is derived "malchuyoth" (melech = king)].
10:11	And it was, in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud departed from over the mishkan of the Testimony [(Israel was in Chorev, then, twelve months less ten days.)]
10:12	And Israel embarked on their travels from the desert of Sinai [in the order of their standards, as prescribed], and the cloud came to rest in the desert of Paran [in Kivroth Hata'avah (12:34)].
10:13	They traveled for the first time by word of the L rd, at the hand of Moses.
10:14	The standard of the camp of the children of Yehudah traveled first, according to their hosts. And over his host, Nachshon ben Aminadav.
10:15	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Yissachar, Nethanel ben Tzuar.
10:16	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zevulun, Eliyav ben Cheilon.
10:17	And when the mishkan was taken down, there set forth the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, the bearers of the mishkan. [When the standard of Yehudah set forth, Aaron and his sons entered and removed the parocheth and covered the ark with it. Then the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari dismantled the mishkan and loaded it in wagons. The ark and holy vessels to be borne by the children of Kehath stood covered and readied on staves until the standard of the camp of Reuven set forth, whereupon (21): "And the Kehathim set forth."]
10:18	And the standard of the camp of Reuven set forth according to their hosts; and over his host, Elitzur ben Shedeur.
10:19	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Shimon, Shelumiel ben Tzurishadai.
10:20	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad, Elyasaf ben De'uel.
10:21	And the Kehathim set forth, the bearers of the holy things, and they [the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari (when they saw the signal for encamping on the standard of the camp of Yehudah)], set up the mishkan [so that it was ready to receive the ark, the table, the menorah, and the altars], by the time they [the sons of Kehath (who were traveling two standards behind)] arrived.
10:22	And the standard of the children of Ephraim set forth according to their hosts; and over his host, Elishama ben Amihud.
10:23	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Menasheh, Gamliel ben Pedatzur.
10:24	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Binyamin, Avidan ben Gidoni.
10:25	And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forth, the rearward of all the camps, according to their hosts; and over his host, Achiezer ben Amishadai.
10:26	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher, Pagiel ben Achran.
10:27	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naftali, Achira ben Einan.
10:28	This is the traveling order of the children of Israel according to their hosts. And [on that day (11)] they set forth.
10:29	And Moses said to Chovav [Yithro] the son of Reuel the Midianite, the father-in-law of Moses: We are journeying to the place of which the L rd said: It will I give to you [(Within three days we will enter the land)]. Come with us and we will do good with you, for the L rd has spoken (the doing of) good for Israel.
10:30	And he said to him: I will not go; but to my land, [for the sake of my possessions] and to my kindred, [for the sake of my family], I will go.
10:31	And he said: I pray you, do not leave us, [so that it not be said that you became a proselyte only in expectation of a portion in the land, which, seeing not to be forthcoming, you abandoned us.] [Indeed, it becomes you to remain with us] inasmuch as you have known our camping in the desert [and have seen the miracles and wonders wrought for us], and you have been "eyes" for us.
10:32	And it shall be, if you go with us, that good which the L rd will accord to us, we shall accord to you. [(The children of Yithro were given the choicest land of Jericho as a holding until it reverted to the tribe of Binyamin.)]
10:33	And they traveled from the mountain of the L rd, a journey of three days. [They traveled a three-days distance in one day, the Holy One Blessed be He desiring to bring them immediately into the land.] And the ark of the covenant of the L rd [the ark with the broken tablets, which went out with them to war)] preceded them, a distance of three days, to look out a resting place for them.
10:34	And the cloud of the L rd was above them by day when they set forth from the encampment.
10:35	[There are signs (inverted nuns) before (this verse) and after (the next verse) to indicate that this is not where these verses actually belong; they were inserted here to create a hiatus between one misfortune and another (see Shabbath 116a)] and it was, when the ark traveled that Moses said: "Stand [and wait for us (the ark preceding them a three-days distance)], O L rd, and let Your foes [Your massed foes] be scattered, and let Your haters [the enemies of Israel (those in pursuit)] flee before You."
10:36	And when it came to rest, he said: "Rest, O L rd, upon the [two] ten thousands [and two] thousands of Israel," [the Shechinah not resting in Israel upon fewer than twenty-two thousand.]
11
11:1	And the people, [the wicked ones,] were as seekers of a pretext [to forsake Him], that was evil in the ears of the L rd [i.e., that would antagonize Him when it reached His ears and would provoke Him. They said: "Woe unto us — how this three-days journey has wearied us!"] And the L rd heard and His wrath was kindled [(He said:) I did this for your own good, so that you would enter the land immediately! (see 10:33)], and the fire of the L rd burned in them, and it devoured in the "end" of the camp [i.e., the lowest among them, the eirav rav (the mixed multitude)].
11:2	And the people cried out to Moses [to intercede for them], and Moses prayed to the L rd, and the fire sank [in its place, into the earth. (Had it retreated, it would have consumed that area.)]
11:3	And he called the name of that place "Taveirah" (conflagration), for the fire of the L rd burned in them.
11:4	And the rabble that was among them [the mixed multitude that had gathered unto them in Egypt] lusted lust, and the children of Israel also wept again [with them], and they said: "Who shall give us flesh to eat!" [(They had flesh [see Exodus 12:38 and Numbers 32:1] — they were only seeking a pretext)].
11:5	We remember the fish that we would eat in Egypt, free [of mitzvoth], the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic. [The (flavor of the) manna would change into any (flavor they desired) except these, for they are harmful to nursing women.]
11:6	And now, our souls are dry; there is nothing. Only to the manna is our eyes [Manna in the morning; manna in the evening!]
11:7	[What follows is an "interjection" by the Holy One Blessed be He, viz.: See what My children are railing against!] The manna was [round] like coriander seed, and it looked like crystal.
11:8	The people would stroll out and gather it [effortlessly], and they would grind it in a mill, or beat it in a mortar, or cook it in a pot [i.e., they could make it taste as if it had been ground in a mill, etc.], and they made cakes of it; and its taste was like the "sap" of oil.
11:9	And when the dew descended upon the camp at night, the manna descended upon it.
11:10	And Moses heard the people weeping by its families, [who gathered together to air their plaints], each at the door of his tent. And the L rd was extremely wroth, and in the eyes of Moses it was evil.
11:11	And Moses said to the L rd: Why have You done evil to Your servant, and why have I not found favor in Your eyes, to place the burden of all this people upon me!
11:12	Did I conceive all this people? Did I beget them, that You say to me: Bear them in your bosom, as a nurse bears a nursling, to the land which You promised to their fathers? [see Exodus 32:34 and 6:13].
11:13	Whence am I to take flesh to give to all this people? For they weep over me, saying: Give us flesh and let us eat!
11:14	I shall not be able to bear alone all this people, for it is beyond my strength.
11:15	And if thus [You will do to them (The L rd showed Moses the calamity that He was going to bring upon them)], You are rendering me "at" [(a term for the feminine), Moses' strength waning as that of a woman]. Kill me, I pray You, if I have found favor in Your eyes, and let me not witness my [(a "euphemism" for "their")] evil.
11:16	And the L rd said to Moses [Here is My response to your "I shall not be able to bear alone"]: Gather unto Me seventy men from the elders of Israel [(The original elders had been killed at Taveirah in delayed retribution for their sin [see Exodus 24:11] (delayed so as not to dampen the joy of the giving of the Torah)], whom you know to be the elders of the people and its officers, [who were appointed over them in Egypt (Since they pitied them and were smitten by the Egyptians because of them, it is only fitting that they be raised in Israel's greatness as they shared in its woes.)], and take them to the tent of meeting, and have them stand there with you, [so that the people see, and accord them honor, saying: How beloved these must be, who entered with Moses to hear the Word from the mouth of the Holy One Blessed be He!]
11:17	And I shall go down and speak with you, [but not with them,] there. And I shall increase, from the spirit which is upon you, and I will place it upon them, [as all take light from a lamp on a menorah, without that lamp losing any of its own light.] And they shall bear with you the burden of the people [Stipulate with them: (This grandeur is being accorded them) on condition that they take upon themselves the wardship of My children, who are troublesome and refractory], and you shall not bear alone. [Thus, the response to "I shall not be able to bear alone."]
11:18	And to the people shall you say: Prepare yourselves for [retribution] tomorrow, and you shall eat flesh. For you have wept in the ears of the L rd, saying: Who shall feed us flesh? For it was good for us in Egypt. And the L rd shall give you flesh and you shall eat.
11:19	Not one day shall you eat, and not two days, and not five days, and not ten days, and not twenty days.
11:20	Until a month of days [(this, with the less wicked, who languished in their beds and their souls expired, see 33)], until it comes out of your nostrils [i.e., until it becomes loathsome to you], and it will be rejected by you [more than you sought it]. For you have despised the L rd who is in your midst [(Had I not reposed My shechinah among you, your hearts would not have been "inflated" unto all these things)], and you have wept before Him, saying: Why, now, did we leave Egypt!
11:21	And Moses said: Six hundred thousand foot are the people in whose midst I am, and You say: Meat shall I give to them, and they shall eat a month of days!
11:22	If flocks and herds are slaughtered for them, will it be sufficient for them! If all the fish of the sea are gathered for them, will it be sufficient for them! [i.e., even if You give them what they ask, they will not be satisfied, for they are simply seeking a pretext against You.]
11:23	And the L rd said to Moses: Shall the hand of the L rd be found wanting? [i.e., If I do not give it, they will call My omnipotence into question. At this, Moses said: Let me go and attempt to conciliate them — whereupon the L rd said:] Now You will see whether My word [that they will not heed you] will befall you or not.
11:24	And Moses went out and told the people the words of the L rd, [viz.: "Shall the hand of the L rd be found wanting?" Did He not give you water from the rock, etc.? (but they did not heed him and denied G d's ability to satisfy their present need)]; and, [seeing that he was not being heeded], he gathered seventy men from the elders of the people, and he stood them roundabout the tent.
11:25	And the L rd descended in a cloud and He spoke to him, and He increased from the spirit which was upon him [see 17], and He placed it upon the seventy men, the elders. And it was, when the spirit rested upon them, that they prophesied — but [after that day], they prophesied no more.
11:26	And there remained two men [of those who had been chosen as elders] in the camp, the name of the one, Eldad; the name of the other, Medad, and the spirit rested upon them. And they were among those [designated as "elders"] on the ballots, but they did not go out to the tent, [saying: We are not worthy of this greatness], and they prophesied in the camp.
11:27	And the youth [(some say it was Gershon, the son of Moses)] ran, and told Moses, saying: Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.
11:28	And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses from his youth, responded and said: My Lord Moses, cause them to cease [from prophesying ("Saddle them" with community service and they will cease prophesying of themselves.)]
11:29	And Moses said to him: Are you zealous for my sake? Would that all the L rd's people were prophets, that the L rd would place His spirit upon them!
11:30	And Moses retired [from the tent of meeting] into [his tent in] the camp, he and the elders of Israel. [(The L rd did not punish Israel until each one of the righteous had entered his tent)].
11:31	And a wind went forth from the L rd and "flew in" quail from the sea, and it spread over the camp, about a day's journey on one side and a day's journey on the other, roundabout the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth. [They hovered chest-high so that they could be easily gathered in.]
11:32	And the people rose all that day and all the night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quail. He that gathered least, [the indolent and the lame], gathered ten chamarim (homers), and they spread them in layers roundabout the camp.
11:33	The flesh was yet between their teeth [(this, with the wicked, see 10)], not yet consumed, when the wrath of the L rd burned against the people; and the L rd smote the people with a very great plague.
11:34	And he called the name of that place Kivroth Hata'avah ("the graves of the lust"); for there they buried the people that lusted.
11:35	From Kivroth Hata'avah the people traveled to Chatzeiroth, and they abode in Chatzeiroth.
12
12:1	And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of [his divorcing] the Cushite woman [(Zipporah, called "Cushite" because she was extremely beautiful in all respects)] that he had taken; for he had taken a Cushite woman, [and now he had divorced her]. [Miriam was with Tzipporah when Moses was told that Eldad and Medad were prophesying in the camp, and she heard her exclaim: "Woe to the wives of these men upon whom prophesy has been conferred, and who will separate from their wives just as my husband (Moses) has separated from me!" Miriam thereupon apprised Aaron of this, (wherefore, being the initiator of the talk against Moses, she is mentioned first)].
12:2	And they said: Is it only with Moses that the L rd has spoken? Has He not spoken also with us? [and we have not separated from our spouses!] And the L rd heard.
12:3	And the man Moses was extremely humble [lowly and forbearing], more than any man on the face of the earth.
12:4	And the L rd said suddenly to Moses, to Aaron, and to Miriam ["suddenly," when they (Aaron and Miriam) were unclean through intercourse, and they cried for water (to purify themselves with) — this, by way of impressing upon them that Moses being constantly ("suddenly") subject to a visitation by the Shechinah, did well in separating himself from his wife] (The L rd said:) The three of you go out to the tent of meeting [(the three were called by a single utterance, something which (within the framework of nature) the mouth is not capable of uttering nor the ear of hearing)]; and the three of them went out.
12:5	And the L rd descended in a pillar of cloud, and He stood at the door of the tent, and He called Aaron and Miriam [to separate them from Moses, (all of a man's praise not being mentioned to his face, see Genesis 7:1)], and the two of them came forth.
12:6	And He said: Hear, I pray you, My words. If there be prophets among you, "the L rd" [i.e., the immanence of My Name] I invest him with in a vision; in a dream I speak to him.
12:7	Not so My servant Moses. In all My house he is trusted.
12:8	Mouth to mouth I spoke to him [i.e., I told him to separate from his wife (see Deuteronomy 5:27-28)], and [in clear] revelation [of My words], and not in riddles; and the configuration [i.e., the "back" (see Exodus 33:23)] of the L rd does he behold. Why, then, did you not fear to speak against My servant, [even if he were not Moses], against Moses, [even if he were not My servant]!
12:9	And the wrath of the L rd burned against them, and He departed. [After apprising them of their wrongdoing, He placed them under the ban (whence it is to be derived that one may not manifest anger against his neighbor until he informs him of his guilt.)]
12:10	And after the cloud had departed from above the tent — behold, Miriam was as leprous as the snow. [("after the cloud had departed":) As a king would say to a pedagogue: "Punish my son — but wait until I have gone."] And Aaron turned to Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.
12:11	And Aaron said to Moses: Pray, my lord, do not impute transgression to us in that we have been foolish and have sinned.
12:12	Let her [this, our sister,] not be as a dead one [(a leper is reckoned as a dead one, both the leprous and the dead causing uncleanliness by entry (into their domain)]. Since he [the "dead one"] comes out of his [brother's] mother's womb, [then if that brother is in a position to help and does not,] it is as if half his (the latter's) flesh had been consumed, [his brother being his "flesh" (Genesis 37:27)].
12:13	And Moses cried out to the L rd to say [whether He would heal her or not]: "G d, I beseech You; heal her, I beseech You." [(whence it is derived that one who asks a favor of his friend should begin with several words of imploration)] [Moses was not "profuse" in prayer, so that Israel not say of him: "His sister is in distress and he stretches out his prayer!"]
12:14	And the L rd said to Moses [This is G d's "answer" (13)]: Now if her father had spat in her face, would she not be in shame for seven days? [How much more, if the Shechinah "does so"!] Let her be sequestered seven days outside the camp, and then [like a leper who is healed of his leprosy] let her be gathered in.
12:15	And Miriam was sequestered outside the camp seven days, and the people did not journey until Miriam had been gathered in. [G d accorded her this honor because of the brief time she had detained herself on Moses' behalf when he had been cast into the Nile (Exodus 2:4)].
12:16	And afterwards the people traveled from Chatzeiroth, and they encamped in the desert of Paran.

13
13:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
13:2	[The rationale of the juxtaposition of the episode of the spies with that of Miriam: These wicked ones beheld her being smitten for slandering her brother and they failed to take reproof (against slander) therefrom.] Send men at your volition [(I am not commanding you to do so, but if you wish to accede to Israel's request to send spies (see Deuteronomy 1:22), you may do so)], and have them spy out the land of Canaan which I am giving to the children of Israel. One man, respectively, for the tribe of his fathers shall you send, each a chief among them.
13:3	And Moses sent them from the desert of Paran by leave of the L rd, all [eminent] men, heads of the children of Israel, were they.
13:4	And these are their names: Of the tribe of Reuven, Shamua ben Zakkur.
13:5	Of the tribe of Shimon, Shafat ben Chori.
13:6	Of the tribe of Yehudah, Calev ben Yefuneh.
13:7	Of the tribe of Yissachar, Yigal ben Yosef.
13:8	Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea bin Nun.
13:9	Of the tribe of Binyamin, Palti ben Rafu.
13:10	Of the tribe of Zevulun, Gadiel ben Sodi.
13:11	Of the tribe of Joseph, of the tribe of Menasheh, Gadi ben Sussi.
13:12	Of the tribe of Dan, Amiel ben Gamli.
13:13	Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur ben Michael.
13:14	Of the tribe of Naftali, Nachbi ben Vafsi.
13:15	Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel ben Machi.
13:16	These are the names of the men that Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea bin Nun "Yehoshua" [He prayed for him: "May the L rd (Kah) save you (yoshiacha) from the counsel of the spies."]
13:17	And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and he said to them [(like a merchant, showing the "poorer wares" first)]: Go up this (way) in the south, and ascend the mountain.
13:18	And see what kind of land it is [(Some lands "breed" strong men; others, weak ones — some, large populations; others, small ones)]. And the people dwelling upon it — Are they strong or weak? Are they few or numerous?
13:19	And what is the land that they dwell in? Is it good [i.e., Does it possess good and healthful springs and pools?] or bad? And what are the cities that they dwell in? Are they open or walled?
13:20	And what of the land? Is it fat or lean? Does it possess a "tree" [i.e., a worthy man, who will shield it in his merit], or not? And strengthen yourselves, and take of the fruit of the land. And the days were the days of the first-ripening of the grapes.
13:21	And they went up and spied out the land, from the desert of Tzin until Rechov, approaching Chamath [i.e., they traversed its boundaries, length and width — the southern boundary, east to west, and the western boundary until its northern tip (see 34:7-8)].
13:22	And they went up in the south, and he [Calev] came until Chevron [(He prostrated himself on the graves of the patriarchs to be saved from the counsel of the spies)]. And there, were Achiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of the giant. And Chevron [the lowest-grade soil in Canaan] was superior, seven-fold to Tzoan [the highest-grade soil] in Egypt.
13:23	And they came to the river-bed of Eshkol, and they cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes [on it], and they [eight of them] carried it by pole, on two [poles], and (they took) of the pomegranates [one man carrying them], and of the figs [another carrying them, (Joshua and Calev carrying nothing, the entire intent of the spies being to draw an analogy from the "awesomeness" of the fruit to that of the inhabitants)].
13:24	That place was called the river bed of Eshkol (cluster) because of the cluster that the children of Israel cut from there.
13:25	And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.
13:26	And they went and they came [(Just as their coming was with evil counsel, so had been their going)], to Moses and to Aaron and to the entire congregation of the children of Israel, to the desert of Paran, to Kadesh; and they returned word to them [to Moses and Aaron] and to the entire congregation, and they showed them the fruits of the land.
13:27	And they told him and they said: We came to the land to which you sent us, and it is, indeed, flowing with milk and honey, and these are its fruits. [(Any falsehood which does not contain an element of truth in the beginning will not endure in the end.)]
13:28	But the people are strong, who dwell in the land, and the cities are fortified, very great; and also the children of the giant did we see there.
13:29	Amalek dwells in the land of the south [(Because they had already been "burnt" by Amalek, the spies mentioned them (first) in order to intimidate the people)], and the Chitti and the Yevussi and the Emori dwell in the mountain, and the Canaani dwell [right] by the sea and by the Jordan [and you will not be able to cross].
13:30	And Calev silenced the people [to hear (as they thought) what he would speak] against Moses. And he said: [Even if he (Moses) told us: Go up to heaven (with ladders)], we would go up and we would inherit it, for we would prevail against it.
13:31	And the men who went up with him said: We shall not be able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than He.
13:32	And they gave out the evil report of the land which they had spied out to the children of Israel, saying: The land which we passed through to spy out is a land which consumes its inhabitants [i.e., we found them burying the dead wherever we passed (The Holy One Blessed be He had done this for their good, to preoccupy the natives with their dead so that they not pay heed to the spies!)], and all of the people that we saw in it are men of [great] dimensions.
13:33	And there we saw the Nefilim ("fallen ones") [giants of the sons of Shamchazai and Azael, who had fallen from heaven in the generation of Enosh], the sons of Anak, from the Nefilim, ["dwarfing" (ma'anikim) the sun with their height]. And we were in our eyes like grasshoppers, and so were we in their eyes [(We heard them saying: "There are ants in the vineyards that look like men!")]
14
14:1	And the entire congregation [the Sanhedrin] lifted their voice and clamored and the people cried on that night.
14:2	And all of the children of Israel railed against Moses and Aaron, and the entire congregation said to them: Would that we had died in the land of Egypt, or would that we had died in this desert!
14:3	And why is the L rd bringing us to this land to fall by the sword, (with) our wives and little ones to be taken as spoil? Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?
14:4	And one man said to the other: Let us make a leader and return to Egypt.
14:5	And Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before the entire assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
14:6	And Yehoshua bin Nun and Calev ben Yefuneh, of those who had spied out the land, rent their garments.
14:7	And they spoke to the entire congregation of the children of Israel, saying: The land which we passed through to spy out — the land is good, extremely good.
14:8	If the L rd desires us, He will bring us to this land, and He will give it to us, a land which flows milk and honey.
14:9	Only against the L rd do not rebel, and you will no longer fear the people of the land, for they are our "bread" [to be consumed by us]: Their shade has departed from them [i.e., their worthy ones, who shielded them, (e.g., Iyyov) have died], and the L rd is with us; do not fear them.
14:10	And the entire congregation said to stone them [Yehoshua and Calev], and the glory of the L rd appeared in the tent of meeting [(the cloud descended there)] to all the children of Israel.
14:11	And the L rd said to Moses: How long will this people provoke Me, and how long will they not believe in Me, after all the signs that I wrought in their midst!
14:12	I shall smite them with the pestilence and eradicate them, and [as for My oath to the patriarchs], I shall make you a nation greater and mightier than they.
14:13	And Moses said to the L rd: When Egypt, from whose midst You with Your might, brought up this people, will hear [of Your destroying them],
14:14	They will say about the inhabitants of this land: They have heard that You, the L rd, are in the midst of this people, that face to face You, the L rd, appear to them, and that Your cloud stands over them, and that in a pillar of cloud You go before them by day and in a pillar of fire by night —
14:15	If You put this people to death as one man — [(Egypt will say that)] the nations who heard of You [i.e., of Your great love for Israel, (not knowing of their having sinned against You)] will say:
14:16	It is because of the L rd's inability to bring this people into the land that He swore to (give) them, [(G d being able to overcome one king (Pharaoh) but not thirty-one)], that He slaughtered them in the desert.
14:17	And now, let the power of the L rd be magnified, I pray You, as You have spoken [See Sanhedrin 111a]:
14:18	"The L rd withholds wrath and He is abundant in lovingkindness. He forgives sin and rebellion, and He absolves [those who repent] (and) He does not absolve [those who do not repent]. He remembers the sins of fathers upon sons, upon the third [generation] and upon the fourth."
14:10	Forgive, I pray You, the sin of this people in the greatness of Your lovingkindness, and as You have forgiven this people from Egypt until now.
14:20	And the L rd said: I have forgiven because of your words [viz., lest they say: "It is because of the L rd's inability, etc."]
14:21	However, [I swear that] as I live and as the glory of the L rd fills all the earth,
14:22	That all the men who saw My glory and My signs that I performed in Egypt and in the desert, and who proved Me this ten times [see Erchin 15a] and did not hearken to My voice —
14:23	They shall not see the land that I swore to their forefathers, and all who provoke Me shall not see it.
14:24	And My servant Calev, because he had a different spirit in him, [telling the spies one thing ("I am with you"), but intending to speak the truth (see 13:30)], and he filled [his heart to follow] after Me, I shall bring him to the land where he came [(Chevron shall be given to him)], and his seed will drive out [its inhabitants].
14:25	And the Amaleki and the Canaani dwell in the valley [(If you go there they will kill you, for I will not be with you.)] Tomorrow, turn back, and travel in the desert by way of the Red Sea.
14:26	And the L rd spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying:
14:27	How long for this evil congregation [the spies (whence it is derived that a "congregation" is ten)], who stir up complaint against Me? The complaints of the children of Israel, whom they [the spies] stir up against Me, have I heard.
14:28	Say to them: As I live, says the L rd — Just as you have spoken in My ears [(2): "…or would that we had died in this desert"] — thus shall I do to you.
14:29	In this desert shall your carcasses fall, and all your number according to all of your count [i.e., according to any count that you take, such as for army duty or for the giving of shekalim] from twenty years and above [(excluding the Levites, who are not counted from twenty)], whom you stirred up against Me.
14:30	If you come (i.e., you shall not come) to the land concerning which I lifted My hand (in oath) to settle you therein — except Calev ben Yefuneh and Yehoshua bin Nun.
14:31	And your little ones, of whom you said that they would fall spoil — I shall bring them (into the land), and they will know the land which you despised.
14:32	But as for you — your carcasses shall fall in this desert.
14:33	And your children will wander in the desert forty years [(so that those who were twenty at the time reach the age of sixty, none to die before that age)], and they shall bear your guilts [plural, that of the golden calf (of their first year in the desert — see Exodus 32:32) and that of the "railing" (these "combining" with the sin of the spies in the second year)], until your carcasses are consumed in the desert.
14:34	According to the number of days that you spied out the land, forty days — a day for a year, a day for a year — shall you bear your sins, forty years, and you shall know (of) your removal [of your hearts] from Me.
14:35	I, the L rd, have spoken, if I do not do this (i.e., I shall do this) to all this evil congregation who have assembled against Me. In this desert shall they be consumed, and there shall they die.
14:36	And the men whom Moses had sent to spy out all the land and who, upon their return, stirred up the entire congregation, generating speech against the land —
14:37	Those men died, who had generated evil speech of the land, in the ["apposite"] plague before the L rd [i.e., within His system of "measure for measure" (Their slanderous tongues uncoiled to their navels, and worms oozed from their tongues into their navels)].
14:38	And Yehoshua bin Nun and Calev ben Yefuneh lived from [the portions of] those men who went to spy out the land.
14:39	And Moses spoke these words to all the children of Israel, and the people mourned exceedingly.
14:40	And they arose early in the morning, and they went up to the top of the mountain [leading to Eretz Yisrael], saying: We are ready, and we will go up to the place [Eretz Yisrael] of which the L rd has spoken [to give it to us], for we have sinned [in saying: "Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt!"]
14:41	And Moses said: Why do you now transgress the word of the L rd? It [what you are about to do] will not succeed.
14:42	Do not go up, for the L rd is not in your midst, and do not be smitten before your foes.
14:43	For the Amaleki and the Canaani are there before you, and you will fall by the sword. For this [will befall you] for having turned back from the L rd, and the L rd will not be with you.
14:44	And they made bold to go up to the top of the mountain, and the ark of the covenant of the L rd and Moses did not stir from the midst of the camp.
14:45	And the Amaleki came down and the Canaani, who lived in that mountain, and they smote them and continued smiting them until the Charmah ["Devastation" (so called after the event)].
15
15:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
15:2	Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: When you come to the land of your dwellings which I shall give to you,
15:3	And you would offer a fire-offering to the L rd, a burnt-offering or a sacrifice, for an expressed vow or as a gift-offering, or in [fulfillment of the obligations of] your festivals, to present a sweet savor to the L rd [i.e., to "gratify" Him], of the herd or of the flock.
15:4	Then he that brings his offering shall present [with each beast] a meal-offering, an issaron of flour mixed with a revi'ith of a hin of oil, [(the meal-offering to be burnt entirely (the oil intermixed with it), and the wine (see below) for the (altar) basins.]
15:5	And wine for libations, a revi'ith of a hin shall you present [in addition to the meal-offering and the oil] with the burnt-offering or the sacrifice, for each lamb.
15:6	And if it is a ram, then you shall present as the meal-offering two esronim of flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil.
15:7	And wine for libations, a third of a hin shall you offer, a sweet savor to the L rd.
15:8	And if you offer a bullock as a burnt-offering or as a sacrifice for an expressed vow or as peace-offerings to the L rd.
15:9	Then he shall present with the bullock a meal-offering, three esronim of flour mixed with oil, a half hin.
15:10	And wine shall you offer for libations, half a hin, a fire-offering [("fire-offering" relates to the meal-offering and the oil)], a sweet savor to the L rd.
15:11	Thus shall it be done for the one ox or for the one ram, or for the lamb among the sheep or among the goats.
15:12	According to the number [of animals] that you offer, so shall you offer [libations] for [each] one, according to their number.
15:13	All the native-born shall thus do these (things) to present a fire-offering, a sweet savor to the L rd.
15:14	And if a stranger sojourn among you, or whoever is among you throughout your generations, and he would offer a fire-offering, a sweet savor to the L rd — as you do, so shall he do.
15:15	The congregation — one statute shall there be for you and for the stranger that sojourns (among you), an everlasting statute unto your generations: As you are, so shall the stranger be, before the L rd.
15:16	One Torah and one judgment shall there be for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you.
15:17	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
15:18	Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: Upon your coming to the land whither I bring you,
15:19	It shall be, when you eat of the bread of the land, that you shall separate an offering for the L rd.
15:20	[Of] the first [i.e., before you eat of it] of your dough [the amount that you were wont to knead in the desert, i.e., an omer], [one] challah shall you separate as an offering; as the terumah of the threshing floor [for which no specific minimum quantity is stated (as opposed to the terumah of ma'aser)], so shall you offer it.
15:21	Of the first of your dough [i.e., of the first of your (one) dough (and not the whole of the first of several doughs)] shall you give [(an amount that satisfies "giving")] to the L rd, an offering throughout your generations.
15:22	And if you err and not do all of these mitzvoth [i.e., if you commit one transgression (idolatry), which is tantamount to non-performance of all of the mitzvoth], which the L rd spoke to Moses [i.e., the first two (of the ten) commandments (interdicting idolatry), which we heard directly from the mouth of the L rd],
15:23	All that the L rd commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day the L rd commanded and onwards throughout your generations [(One who acknowledges idolatry denies the entire Torah and all that the prophets have prophesied)],
15:24	It shall be, if by the eyes of the congregation (the sanhedrin) it were done in error [i.e., if they erroneously ruled a service that is forbidden to be performed for idolatry to be permitted], then all the congregation shall offer one young bullock as a burnt-offering as a sweet savor to the L rd, with its meal-offering and its libation as ordained, and one kid of goats as a sin-offering [(after the burnt-offering, as opposed to all other instances, where the sin-offering precedes the burnt-offering)].
15:25	And the Cohein shall make atonement for the entire congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them, for it was unwitting; and they have brought their offering [(that mentioned above)]: a fire-offering to the L rd [the bullock for the burnt-offering] and their sin-offering [the kid] before the L rd for their error.
15:26	And it shall be forgiven to the entire congregation of the children of Israel and to the stranger who sojourns in their midst; for to all the people it was in error.
15:27	And if one soul sin [(the sin of idolatry)] in error, he shall bring a she-goat of the first year as a sin-offering [(Whereas for other transgressions he may bring either a she-lamb or a she-goat)].
15:28	And the Cohein shall make atonement for the soul that is unwitting in sinning in error before the L rd, to atone for him; and he shall be forgiven.
15:29	(For) the native-born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourns among them; one Torah shall there be for you for him who acts unwittingly.
15:30	And the soul who acts with a high hand [i.e., wilfully], of the native-born and of the stranger — it is the L rd whom he blasphemes; and that soul shall be cut off from the midst of its people.
15:31	For the word of the L rd [i.e., the exhortation against idolatry, which he heard directly from the L rd (as opposed to the others, which he heard from Moses)] he has despised, and His commandment he has broken. Cut off shall be that soul [when] its transgression is in it [i.e., when he has not repented].
15:32	And the children of Israel were in the desert, [having observed only one Sabbath], when they found a man gathering wood on the [second] Sabbath day.
15:33	And the ones who found him gathering wood [(and not ceasing even after they had warned him)] brought him near to Moses and to Aaron and to the entire congregation.
15:34	And they placed him in ward, for it was not made clear what should be done with him [i.e., which death penalty he was to receive].
15:35	And the L rd said to Moses: The man is to be put to death [by] the entire congregation's stoning him with stones outside the camp.
15:36	And the entire congregation took him outside the camp [(whence it is seen that the stoning site is outside of beth-din and distant from it)], and they stoned him with stones and he died, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
15:37	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
15:38	Speak to the children of Israel and say to them that they (shall) make for themselves tzitzith [fringes] on the corners of their garments throughout their generations; and they shall put on the tzitzith (on) the corner a strand of tcheleth [a bluish dye obtained from the chilazon (a kind of shell-fish)].
15:39	And it shall be for you for tzitzith, and you shall see it and you shall remember all the mitzvoth of the L rd [(The gematria of "tzitzith" is 600, which, together with 8 (the strings) and 5 (the ties) gives 613 (the number of the mitzvoth)]. And you shall do them, and you shall not "spy out" [transgressions] after your hearts and after your eyes [the "procurers" of sin], after which you go astray.
15:40	So that you remember and do all of My mitzvoth; and you shall be holy to your G d.
15:41	I am the L rd, [(trusted to reward)], your G d, [(trusted to exact payment)], who took you out of the land of Egypt to be a G d to you [i.e., so that you accept My decrees]; I am the L rd your G d [ — perforce! (You do not have the option of saying: "We shall not do the mitzvoth and not receive reward.")]
Korach
16
16:1	And Korach set himself apart [from the midst of the congregation (to contend against the "awarding" of the priesthood to Aaron)], the son of Yitzhar, the son of Kehath, the son of Levi [("the son of Jacob" being omitted in consideration of Jacob's prayer (Genesis 49:6)], and Dathan and Aviram, the sons of Eliav [(of the tribe of Reuven, neighbors of Korach in the southern encampment — "Woe to the wicked one; woe to his neighbor!")], and On, the son of Peleth, sons [i.e., descendants] of Reuven.
16:2	And they arose before Moses — and men of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty, chiefs of the congregation, designates of the time, people of name.
16:3	And they banded against Moses and against Aaron and they said to them: [You have arrogated] too much for yourselves. For the entire congregation are all holy [(all of them heard things from the mouth of the L rd on Sinai)], and the L rd is in their midst, and why would you raise yourselves above the congregation of the L rd? [If you (Moses) took kingship you should not have taken priesthood for your brother.]
16:4	And Moses heard, and he fell on his face, ["felled" by their seditiousness].
16:5	And he spoke to Korach and to his whole congregation, saying: In the morning [(Moses pushing them off on the chance of their repenting)], the L rd will make known who is His [for levitical service] and the holy one [for the priesthood], and He will draw [them] near to Him. And whom He will choose, He will draw near to Him.
16:6	Do this: Take for yourselves fire-pans [coal-rakers with handles], Korach and his entire congregation.
16:7	And place in them fire, and put incense upon them before the L rd tomorrow [(the offering of the incense being the choicest of the high-priestly services — but that which killed Nadav and Avihu, who were not elected for it)], and it shall be, the man whom the L rd shall choose, he is the holy one [(I warn you: Just as we have only one G d, we have only one high-priest; he shall be proved to be "the holy one"; the others, perforce, having offered "strange fire," shall die.)] A great thing have you taken upon yourselves, O sons of Levi [to contend with the Holy One Blessed be He].
16:8	And Moses said to Korach [He began to speak to him gently, but seeing him to be adamant, and fearing that the other tribes might join him and perish with him, he began exhorting them, viz.:] Hear, I pray you, O sons of Levi.
16:9	Is it too little for you that the G d of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel to draw you near to Him to perform the service of the mishkan of the L rd and to stand before the congregation [on the duchan (the platform) to sing] to serve them?
16:10	And that He has brought you near and all of your brothers, the sons of Levi, with you [to that service from which He excluded the rest of the congregation of Israel] that you also seek priesthood!
16:11	Therefore, you, and all of your congregation who are gathered [together with you] — it is against the L rd [that you are gathered (for it is at His bidding that I conferred the high-priesthood upon Aaron)]; and Aaron, what is he that you rail against him!
16:12	And Moses sent to call to Dathan and to Aviram, the sons of Eliav [(— whence it is derived that one must not nurture dissension, Moses sending to conciliate them)], and they said: "We shall not go up." [Their mouths "tripped them up," for it is "down" that they went.]
16:13	Is it too little that you brought us up from a land flowing milk and honey to put us to death in the desert [see 14:29] that you would also lord it over us!
16:14	You have neither brought us to a land flowing milk and honey, [nor] have you given us an inheritance of field and vineyard. Even if you put out the eyes of "those men" [(a euphemism for themselves)], we shall not go up.
16:15	And Moses was sorely grieved, and he said to the L rd: Do not turn to their offering [(the incense that they will offer tomorrow)]. Not an ass of one of them have I taken [(Even the ass which I took (on their behalf) to transport my family from Midian to Egypt was not theirs but mine!)], and I have not done evil to one of them.
16:16	And Moses said to Korach: You and all your congregation be before the L rd — you and they [your congregation] and Aaron tomorrow.
16:17	And take each man his fire-pan and put incense upon them, and present before the L rd, each man [of the two hundred and fifty], his fire-pan, two hundred and fifty fire-pans; and you and Aaron, each his fire-pan.
16:18	And each man took his fire-pan and they placed fire upon them and put incense upon them. And they stood at the door of the tent of meeting, and Moses and Aaron.
16:19	And Korach convened against them the entire congregation [(whom he had instigated against them by mockery the night before)] at the door of the tent of meeting; and the glory of the L rd appeared to the entire congregation [in a pillar of cloud].
16:20	And the L rd spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying:
16:21	Separate yourselves from the midst of this congregation, and I shall consume them this instant.
16:22	And they fell on their faces and they said: O G d, the G d of the spirits of all flesh, [who knows all of their thoughts (and can distinguish the guilty from the guiltless)], shall one man sin and You rage against the entire congregation!
16:23	And the L rd spoke [(in acquiescence)] to Moses, saying:
16:24	Speak to the congregation, saying: Remove yourselves from around the dwelling of Korach, Dathan, and Aviram.
16:25	And Moses arose and he went to Dathan and Aviram, [thinking they would defer to him], and there went after him the elders of Israel.
16:26	And [(his overture failing)] he spoke to the congregation, saying: Depart, now, from the tents of these wicked men, and do not touch anything that is theirs, lest you perish in all of their sins.
16:27	And they removed themselves from around the dwelling of Korach, Dathan, and Aviram. And Dathan and Aviram went out standing [defiantly, to curse and to blaspheme] at the door of their tents, with their wives, their sons, and their little ones, [the fomenting of strife (unlike other transgressions) rendering even these susceptible to punishment by the Heavenly tribunal.]
16:28	And Moses said: By this shall you know that the L rd sent me to do all these things [viz., to make Aaron high-priest; his sons, deputy priests, and Eltzafan (ben Uziel), the chief of the Kehathi], and that I did not do so of my own volition.
16:29	If as the death of all men these (men) will die and the fate of all men overtake them, then the L rd has not sent me, [(but I will have acted of my own volition and he justly challenges me.)]
16:30	But if the L rd creates a [new] creation [a new kind of death], and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them and all that is theirs, and they descend, living, to Sheol — then you will know that these men have rebelled against the L rd [and that I have acted as His agent].
16:31	And it was, when he had finished speaking all of these things, that the earth split, which was beneath them.
16:32	And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up them and their houses and all the men that were with Korach and all of the wealth.
16:33	And they descended — they and all that was theirs — living, to Sheol. And the earth covered them, and they were lost from the midst of the congregation.
16:34	And all of Israel that were around them fled at their sound [the sound of their being swallowed up], saying: Lest the earth swallow us.
16:35	And a fire went forth from the L rd and consumed the two hundred and fifty men, the presenters of the incense.
17
17:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
17:2	Tell Elazar the son of Aaron the Cohein to lift the fire-pans from the conflagration and to scatter the fire (i.e., the coals) [in the fire-pans to the ground], for they the [fire-pans] have been consecrated [as ministering vessels (and may not be used for profane purposes)] —
17:3	The fire-pans of these who have forfeited their lives [by defying the L rd] — and they shall beat them into plates (as a) covering for the [copper] altar, for they presented them before the L rd and they were consecrated; and they shall be a sign [i.e., a "memorial"] for the children of Israel, [viz.: "These (plates) came from those who contested the priesthood and were burned."]
17:4	And Elazar the Cohein took the copper fire-pans which the burned ones had presented, and he beat them into plating for the altar.
17:5	A sign for the children of Israel, so that a stranger, who is not of the seed of Aaron, not draw near to smoke incense before the L rd, so that he not be like Korach and his congregation, as the L rd spoke to Moses about him [Aaron, viz., that he and his sons are to be Cohanim].
17:6	And the entire congregation of the children of Israel railed on the morrow against Moses and against Aaron, saying: You have put to death the people of the L rd.
17:7	And it was, when the congregation gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they turned to the tent of meeting, and, behold, the cloud covered it and the glory of the L rd appeared.
17:8	And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting.
17:9	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
17:10	Remove yourselves from the midst of this congregation and I will consume them this instant; and they fell on their faces.
17:11	And Moses said to Aaron: Take the fire-pan and place upon it fire from the altar, and put incense (upon it) and take (it) quickly to the congregation and atone for them [(This secret was given to him by the angel of death when he ascended to heaven — that the incense aborts the plague)], for the wrath has gone forth from the L rd; the plague has begun.
17:12	And Aaron took (it) as Moses had commanded and he ran to the midst of the congregation, and, behold, the plague had begun in the people; and he put on the incense and he atoned for the people.
17:13	And he stood between the dead and the living and the plague was aborted.
17:14	And those who died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, aside from those who died in the affair of Korach.
17:15	And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tent of meeting, and the plague was halted.
17:16	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
17:17	Speak to the children of Israel and take from them a staff for a father's house. From all their chiefs, according to the house of their fathers, twelve staffs; the name of each write on his staff.
17:18	And the name of Aaron write on the staff of Levi, for there is one staff for the head of their fathers' house [Though I have divided them into two families, the priestly and the levitical, they remain one tribe.]
17:19	And place them in the tent of meeting before the Testimony, where I am appointed for you.
17:20	And it shall be, the man that I choose, his staff will blossom, and I shall cause to recede from Me the plaints of the children of Israel which they vent against you.
17:21	And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and all of their chiefs gave to him a staff for one chief, a staff for one chief, for the house of their fathers, twelve staffs, and the staff of Aaron in the midst of their staffs, [so that they not attribute its blossoming to its having been placed on the side of the Shechinah.]
17:22	And Moses placed the staffs before the L rd in the tent of the Testimony.
17:23	And it was on the morrow that Moses came into the tent of the Testimony, and, behold, the staff of Aaron of the house of Levi had sprouted, and had blossomed, and had brought forth a [fruit] bud, and had gendered almonds.
17:24	And Moses brought forth all the staffs from before the L rd to all the children of Israel; and they saw, and each took his staff.
17:25	And the L rd said to Moses: Return Aaron's staff before the Testimony for keeping as a sign against the sons of rebellion [that I have chosen Aaron to be priest, so that they not again contest the priesthood], and their caviling cease from Me and they not die.
17:26	And Moses did as the L rd commanded him; thus did he do.
17:27	And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying: Behold, we shall perish; we shall go lost; we shall all go lost!
17:28	Whoever draws near [(We are permitted to enter the court of the tent of meeting)], who draws near [(more than his neighbor and inadvertently enters the tent of meeting,)] to the mishkan of the L rd, will die. Have we been abandoned to death?
18
18:1	And the L rd said [to Moses to say] to Aaron [to exhort him to prevent non-priests from entering the sanctuary]: You and your sons and the house of your father [the children of Kehath, the father of Amram] with you shall bear the sin of the sanctuary [i.e., you will be held responsible for non-priests' sinning with the consecrated things that I have placed in your charge — the tent (of meeting), the ark, the table and the holy vessels. You must keep watch and warn them.] And you and your sons [the Cohanim] with you shall bear the sin of your priesthood, [which is not relegated to the Levites; you must keep them from inadvertently encroaching upon your service.]
18:2	And also your brothers [the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari], the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, draw near with you, and let them be joined to you [to warn also strangers against coming too close to them], and they shall serve you [by guarding the gates and by serving as (Temple) treasurers and trustees], and you and your sons with you, before the tent of Testimony.
18:3	And they shall keep your charge and the charge of all the tent. But to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar they shall not come near, so that they not die, both they and you.
18:4	And they will join you and they will keep the charge of the tent of meeting for all the service of the tent, and a stranger shall not draw near to you [(the Cohanim are being exhorted to this end)].
18:5	And you shall keep the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of the altar, so that there no more be wrath [(as in 17:11)] against the children of Israel.
18:6	And I, behold, I have taken your brothers, the Levites, from the midst of the children of Israel, for you as a gift, given to the L rd [i.e., they are not given to you for your private ends, but for the guarding of the gates, etc. (see 2)], to perform the service of the tent of meeting.
18:7	And you and your sons with you shall guard your priesthood for every thing of the altar and within the parocheth, and you shall serve. I have given your priesthood [to you] as a service of gift, and the stranger that draws near shall be put to death.
18:8	And the L rd spoke to Aaron: And I, behold, I have given to you [with joy the twenty-four priestly gifts, to confirm your title to the priesthood against any claims (such as that of Korach)] the keeping of My terumoth (gifts) [You must "keep" (i.e., preserve) them in cleanliness]. From all the hallowed things of the children of Israel, to you have I given them for greatness, and to your children, as an everlasting statute.
18:9	This shall be for you from the holy of holies from the fire [i.e., after the burning of the devoted portions]: all of their offerings [(such as communal peace-offerings)], and all of their meal-offerings, and all of their sin-offerings, and all of their guilt-offerings, which they shall return to Me [i.e., the theft of a proselyte (see 5:8)]: it is holy of holies to you and to your sons.
18:10	In the holy of holies [the azarah (the place where "holy of holies" are eaten)] shall you eat it. Every male [i.e., only a male] shall eat it; holy shall it be to you.
18:11	And this is for you: the terumah of their gift [-offerings, i.e., what is set apart from the thanksgiving offering, the peace-offerings, and the ram of the Nazirite.] From all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel, to you have I given them, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, as an everlasting statute. Every clean one in your house shall eat it.
18:12	All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat; the first of them [terumah gedolah] which they shall give to the L rd, to you have I given them.
18:13	The first-fruits of all that is in their land, that they bring to the L rd, for you shall it be. Every clean one of your household shall eat it.
18:14	Every devoted thing in Israel shall be yours.
18:15	All that opens the womb of all flesh that they offer to the L rd, in man and in beast, shall be yours; but redeem shall you redeem the first-born of the man, and the first-born of the unclean beast shall you redeem.
18:16	And his redemption, from one month shall you redeem, according to the monetary valuation, five shekalim in the shekel of the sanctuary; it is twenty gerah.
18:17	But the first-born of an ox, or the first-born of a sheep, or the first-born of a goat, you shall not redeem. They are consecrated. Their blood shall you sprinkle upon the altar, and their fats shall you smoke, a fire-offering as a sweet savor to the L rd.
18:18	And their flesh shall be for you; as the wave-breast and the right shoulder [of peace-offerings, which may be eaten for two days and one night] shall they be for you.
18:19	All the terumoth of the holy things, which the children of Israel will separate for the L rd, have I given to you and to your sons and to your daughters with you as an everlasting statute. It is a covenant of salt [(i.e., like salt, which never spoils)] forever before the L rd, for you and for your seed with you. [The L rd made a covenant with Aaron by something (salt) which is itself wholesome and lasting and which preserves other things.]
18:20	And the L rd said to Aaron: In their land you will not inherit, and you will not have a portion [of even the spoils] in their midst. I am your portion and your inheritance in the midst of the children of Israel.
18:21	And to the sons of Levi, behold, I have given every tithe in Israel as an inheritance in exchange for the service which they perform, the service of the tent of meeting.
18:22	And the children of Israel shall no more draw near to the tent of meeting, to bear sin, to die.
18:23	And the Levite shall perform — he — the service of the tent of meeting, and they [the Levites] shall bear their [the Israelites'] sin [if they draw near to the tent of meeting (for the Levites must ward them off)], an everlasting statute for your generations. And in the midst of the children of Israel, they shall not inherit an inheritance.
18:24	For the tithe of the children of Israel which they set apart for the L rd as a terumah [(It is called "terumah" until he (the Levite) separates terumath ma'aser from it)] have I given to the Levites as an inheritance. Therefore, I have said to them that in the midst of the children of Israel they shall not inherit an inheritance.
18:25	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
18:26	And to the Levites shall you speak, and you shall say to them: When you take from the children of Israel the tithe (ma'aser) that I have given to you from them as your inheritance, then you shall separate from it the terumah of the L rd, ma'aser from the ma'aser.
18:27	And your terumah will be accounted for you as corn from the threshing floor [i.e., your terumath ma'aser is forbidden to non-priests and to unclean priests and makes them liable to the death penalty and to the additional fifth, just as does terumah gedolah (which is referred to as "the first of corn from the threshing floor")] and as the fullness [i.e., ripeness (of produce)] of the pit [i.e., and just as does the terumah of wine and oil which is taken from the pit before the press.]
18:28	Thus shall you, too, [just as the Israelites give terumah from their threshing floors and their pits], separate the terumah of the L rd from all of your tithes [(your inheritance)] that you take from the children of Israel; and you shall give of it the terumah of the L rd to Aaron the Cohein.
18:29	From all of your gifts shall you separate all the terumah of the L rd [(If the Levite received his ma'aser before the Cohein received his terumah from the heap, he must first separate that terumah (gedolah), then terumath ma'aser, and give both to the Cohein)]; from all of its best (shall you separate) its hallowed part from it.
18:30	And you (Moses) shall say to them (the Levites): When you separate [as terumath ma'aser] its best part of it, then it [the remaining produce] shall be reckoned [as permitted] to the Levites, just as produce of the threshing floor and produce of the pit [is permitted to the Israelites (after they have tithed it)].
18:31	And you may eat it in every place [even in the cemetery], you and your household; for it is payment to you, in exchange for your service in the tent of meeting.
18:32	And you shall not bear sin because of it when you separate the best part of it, [(but if you do not separate it, you will bear sin.)] And you shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, and you shall not die, [(but if you do profane them, you shall die.)]

19:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying:
19:2	[(In anticipation of the taunts of the gentiles as to the seemingly arbitrary nature of this mitzvah:) This is the statute [i.e., decree] of the Torah [(You are not given license to seek its rationale)], which the L rd has commanded, saying: Speak to the children of Israel and they shall take unto you [(It shall always be called by your name, viz., "the red heifer that Moses 'processed' in the desert")], a red heifer, whole [in its redness (two black hairs invalidate it)], which does not have a blemish, upon which a yoke has not come.
19:3	And you shall give it to Elazar the Cohein [(Its mitzvah is by agency of the adjutant high-priest)]. And he shall take it outside the encampment [i.e., outside the three camps] and he [a non-priest] shall slaughter it before him [i.e., Elazar looking on].
19:4	And Elazar the Cohein shall take of its blood with his finger, and he shall sprinkle of its blood opposite the face of the tent of meeting seven times. [He stands in the east of Jerusalem and directs his gaze to the door of the sanctuary while sprinkling.]
19:5	And he shall burn the heifer before his eyes. Its skin, and its flesh, and its blood, together with its dung, he shall burn.
19:6	And the Cohein shall take cedar wood, and hyssop and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
19:7	And the Cohein shall wash his garments, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and then he may come into the encampment [of the Shechinah (whence he had been excluded)], and the Cohein shall be unclean until the evening [i.e., he shall be unclean until the evening and then he may come into the encampment.]
19:8	And he who burns it shall wash his garments with water and bathe his flesh in water, and he shall be unclean until the evening.
19:9	And a man who is clean shall gather the ashes of the heifer and place it outside the encampment in a clean place. And it shall be for the congregation of the children of Israel in keeping for waters of sprinkling; it is for cleansing.
19:10	And he who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his garments, and he shall be unclean until the evening. And it shall be for the children of Israel and for the sojourner who dwells in their midst as an everlasting statute.
19:11	One who touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.
19:12	He shall be cleansed with it [the ashes] on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean. And if he is not cleansed on the third day, then he shall not be clean on the seventh day.
19:13	Everyone who touches a dead body of the soul of a man that shall die [(This excludes "the soul of a beast," one who touches its carcass not requiring sprinkling)], and he not be cleansed, the tabernacle of the L rd has he defiled [if he enters the tabernacle without the sprinkling of the third and seventh days], and that soul shall be cut off from Israel; for the waters of sprinkling have not been sprinkled upon him. Unclean shall he be; his cleanliness is yet upon him [even if he underwent ritual immersion].
19:14	This is the Torah: A man if he die in a tent — all that enter the tent [while the dead body is still in it] and all that is in the tent shall be unclean seven days.
19:15	And every open [earthen] vessel whose cover is not fastened upon it is unclean.
19:16	And all who touch, on the face of the field, [where there is no tent (in which instance uncleanliness is conferred only through touching)] one slain by the sword, or a dead body, or the bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
19:17	And they shall take for the unclean one from the ashes of the burning of the (heifer for) cleansing, and he shall place upon it (the ashes) living water which is in a vessel.
19:18	And a clean man shall take hyssop and dip it in the water, and he shall sprinkle it upon the tent and upon all the vessels, and upon the souls who were there, and upon him who touched a bone, or a slain one, or a dead body, or a grave.
19:19	And the clean one shall sprinkle on the unclean one on the third day and on the seventh day, and he shall cleanse him on the seventh day [i.e., that is the consummation of his cleansing]; and he shall wash his garments and bathe in water and be clean in the evening.
19:20	And a man, if he becomes unclean and does not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the congregation, for he has defiled the sanctuary of the L rd. The waters of sprinkling have not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.
19:21	And it shall be for them for an everlasting statute. And the sprinkler of the waters of sprinkling [i.e., he who bears an amount sufficient for sprinkling (but not the sprinkler himself)] shall wash his clothing [as opposed to the toucher (whose garments are not rendered unclean)], and he who touches the waters of sprinkling shall be unclean until the evening.
19:22	And all that the unclean one [who touched a dead body] touches shall become unclean; and the soul that touches ["the unclean one" (above)] shall be unclean until the evening.
20
20:1	And the children of Israel came, the entire congregation [i.e., the "intact" congregation (those who were condemned to die in the desert having already expired)], to the desert of Tzin on the first month. And the people dwelt in Kadesh, and Miriam died there [(her death being juxtaposed with the section of the red heifer to teach that just as sacrifices atone, so does the death of the righteous)] [("And Miriam died there") by the mouth of the L rd" (the "Divine kiss") as Aaron (33:38) (Scripture avoids explicit mention of this in the instance of a woman)], and she was buried there.
20:2	And there was no water for the congregation [(whence it is seen that all forty years they had "the well" in Miriam's merit)], and they banded against Moses and against Aaron.
20:3	And the people strove with Moses, saying: Would that we had died by the death of our brothers [(i.e., by pestilence)] before the L rd [(and not by thirst, a sorer death)]
20:4	And why did you bring the congregation of the L rd to this desert, to die there, we and our kine!
20:5	And why did you take us up out of Egypt to bring us to this evil place? It is not a place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates, and there is no water to drink.
20:6	And Moses and Aaron came away from before the congregation to the door of the tent of meeting, and they fell on their faces, and the glory of the L rd appeared to them.
20:7	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
20:8	Take the staff and assemble the congregation, you and Aaron your brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes, and it will give its waters, and bring forth water for them from the rock, and give drink to the congregation and their kine [(whence it is seen that the Holy One Blessed be He is solicitous for the possessions of Israel)].
20:9	And Moses took the staff from before the L rd as He had commanded him.
20:10	And Moses and Aaron assembled the congregation before the rock, and he said to them: Hear, now, you fractious ones: Shall we bring forth water for you from this rock [which has not been designated by the L rd]!
20:11	And Moses lifted his hand and smote the rock with his staff twice, [for at first it had issued forth only drops, Moses not having been commanded to strike it but to speak to it (They had spoken to a different rock before, which had emitted nothing, whereupon they conjectured that perhaps they should strike it, as before (Exodus 17:6), whereupon the intended rock presented itself to them, and he struck it)], and much water came out, and the congregation drank, and their kine.
20:12	And the L rd said to Moses and to Aaron: Because you did not believe in Me to sanctify Me before the eyes of the children of Israel [(for had you just spoken to the rock, and not struck it, they would have reasoned: Now if this rock, which does not speak, and does not hear, and does not require sustenance heeds G d's word, how much more should we do so!)], therefore, [I swear (G d "hastening" to swear, to ward off imploration)]: You shall not bring this congregation to the land which I have given them.
20:13	These are the waters of Merivah (contention) [intimated elsewhere (Exodus 1:22), Pharaoh's astrologers foreseeing the Jewish savior's undoing by water (and erroneously "positing" the Nile as the water)], whereby the children of Israel contended with the L rd, and He was sanctified through them, [Moses and Aaron dying thereby (and the people being struck with awe of the L rd)].
20:14	And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom. Thus said your brother, Israel [(We are both the sons of Abraham, and the "debt" to Pharaoh (Genesis 15:13) devolved upon both of us)]: You knew [of] all of the travail that has befallen us. [Your father Esau separated from his brother Jacob to avoid the payment of the debt (Ibid. 36:6), and he cast it all upon him.]
20:15	And our fathers went down to Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt many days, and Egypt wrought evil unto us [(we suffered many afflictions)], and to our fathers [— whence it is seen that the patriarchs suffer in the grave when afflictions befall Israel.]
20:16	And we cried out to the L rd, and He hearkened to our voice [(in fulfillment of the blessing "the voice is the voice of Jacob" (Genesis 27:22)], and He sent an angel [Moses (whence it is seen that the prophets are called "angels")], and He took us out of Egypt, and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city at the edge of your boundary.
20:17	Let us pass, I pray you through your land [(As you have not paid the "debt," you have no claim to Eretz Yisrael; give us some assistance, then, in allowing us to pass through your land.)] We shall not pass through field or vineyard and we shall not drink the water of a well [i.e., the well that accompanies us; but we shall buy food and drink from you, though we have food (manna) and drink of our own (whence it is derived that though one has what he requires, he should supply some trade for his host.)] We shall go by the king's way. We shall not turn right or left until we have passed your boundaries. [We muzzle our beasts, and they shall not turn aside to eat of what is yours.]
20:18	And Edom said to him: Do not pass through me, lest I go out against you with the sword [(in fulfillment of the blessing to me (Genesis 27:40): "And by your sword shall you live" (see 16 above)].
20:19	And the children of Israel said to him: By the main road shall we go up. And if we drink your water, I and my herds, I shall give its price. Nothing shall harm you; on my feet shall I pass through.
20:20	And he said: You shall not pass through. And Edom went out against him with a large host and with a strong hand [(in the assurance of (Genesis 22:22): "And the hands are the hands of Esau."]
20:21	And Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through his boundary; and Israel turned away from him.
20:22	And they journeyed from Kadesh, and the children of Israel came, all of the congregation [(all of them fit and ready to enter Eretz Yisrael, all of those upon whom it had been decreed not to enter having already died)] to Hor Hahar ["the mountain atop a mountain" (like one apple atop another)].
20:23	And the L rd said to Moses and to Aaron in Hor Hahar on the boundary of the land of Edom [(Because they sought here to "come close" to the wicked Esau (Edom), "a breach was made in their works" (Aaron died)], saying:
20:24	Let Aaron be gathered to his people, for he will not come to the land that I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against My word at the waters of Merivah.
20:25	Take Aaron and Elazar his son ["Take him" with words of consolation — "Happy are you to see your crown (of high-priesthood) given to your son" (something which I have not merited)], and bring them up to Hor Hahar.
20:26	And strip Aaron of his garments [of the high-priesthood (with which he had clothed him)] and clothe Elazar his son in them, and Aaron shall be gathered in and he shall die there.
20:27	And Moses did as the L rd commanded [(Though it was difficult for him to do so, he did not hesitate)], and they went up to Hor Hahar before the eyes of the entire congregation.
20:28	And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and he clothed Elazar his son in them, and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain, and Moses and Elazar descended from the mountain.
20:29	And all the congregation saw that Aaron had died [(They could not believe that Aaron, who had prevailed against the angel of death and stayed the plague (17:12), could be killed by him, until they were shown a vision of Aaron lying upon the bier)], and they mourned Aaron for thirty days, all the house of Israel [(both men and women, for Aaron would "pursue" peace and settle differences between disputants and between husbands and wives.)]
21
21:1	And [when] the Canaanite heard [(The Amalekites changed their language to that of Canaan, so that the Israelites pray for victory over the Canaanites" (which they were not)], the king of Arad, the dweller in the south [i.e., Amalek (see 13:29)] — [when he heard that Aaron had died and the clouds of glory had departed and] that Israel was coming by way of Atharim [the southern route, by which the spies had come (see 13:22)], he fought with Israel, and he captured from them a captive [a single maidservant].
21:2	And Israel vowed a vow unto the L rd and said: If You give this people into my hand [(When Israel saw them dressed as Amalekites and speaking the Canaanite tongue, they said "this people" — whoever they are], then I shall consecrate [the spoils of] their cities [to the L rd].
21:3	And the L rd hearkened to the voice of Israel, and He delivered up the Canaanites, and he (Israel) exterminated them and [he plundered] their cities [(as per 2 above)], and he called the name of the place Charmah ["devastation"].
21:4	And they journeyed from Hor Hahar by way of the Red Sea [(the same way they had turned back by G d's decree (see Deuteronomy 1:40) in the episode of the spies)] to go around the land of Edom, [(having been refused permission to pass through it)], and the soul of the people became constricted [(i.e., unable to "contain" their distress)] by the [duress of the] way [(being "so near and yet so far," and likening their situation to that of their fathers, who turned back thus and languished in the desert for thirty-eight years)].
21:5	And the people spoke against G d and against Moses ["they likened the servant to his Master"]: Why did you ["both of you"] bring us up from Egypt to die in the desert? For there is no bread and there is no water, and our souls are constricted by this flimsy bread [(which is absorbed in our limbs and which must ultimately make us "burst")].
21:6	And the L rd sent against the people the fiery serpents [(which burn by their venom)], and they bit the people, and a large number died of Israel.
21:7	And the people came to Moses and they said: We have sinned, for we spoke against the L rd and against you. Pray to the L rd that He remove the serpent from us; and Moses prayed on behalf of the people.
21:8	And the L rd said to Moses: Make for yourself a fiery serpent (nachash) and place it on a pole. And it shall be, whoever is bitten [(Even if he were bitten by a dog or an ass, he would waste away)], if he sees it [(even without gazing at it intently)], he shall live.
21:9	And Moses made a serpent of copper (nechosheth) [(Since the L rd called it "nachash," he made it of nechosheth)], and he placed it on a pole. And it was, if the snake had bitten a man, when he gazed [intently] at the copper snake, he lived.
21:10	And the children of Israel journeyed, and they encamped in Ovoth.
21:11	And they journeyed from Ovoth, and they encamped in Iyei Ha'avarim [so called because of those who pass (ovrim) Har Nevo there on the way to the land of Canaan, (Har Nevo separating the land of Moav from the land of the Emori)], in the desert, before Moav toward the rising of the sun [i.e., to the east of Moav].
21:12	From there they journeyed, and they encamped in Nachal Zared.
21:13	From there they journeyed, [around the entire southern and eastern border of Moav, (Moav not permitting them to pass through their land)] and they encamped on the [other, northern,] side [of Moav in] Arnon, [Emori territory] which is in the desert, which juts out from the boundary of the Emori. For Arnon is the boundary of Moav, between Moav and the Emori.
21:14	Of this [encampment and the miracles wrought therein] it will be stated in recounting the wars of the L rd [i.e., the miracles wrought by the L rd for our forefathers], what He gave them [i.e., the miracles He performed for them] at the Red Sea and at the valleys of Arnon. [Just as the former miracles are recounted, so should the latter be.]
21:15	[And what are these miracles?] The spilling [of the blood of the Emorites] in the valleys. [The Emorites secreted themselves in mountain crypts on the Moavite side to waylay the Israelites as they passed through, and the mountain on the Emorite side moved forward and crushed them with its projections] — which [mountain] moved [from its place] to fix itself [i.e., its projections] in Ar [of Moav]; it leaned on the boundary of Moav.
21:16	And from there [it (the blood flow) came] to the well. [The well (that followed the Israelites) descended into the valley and brought up from there the blood and the limbs of the slain to apprise Israel of the miracle that had been wrought for them] — the well of which the L rd said to Moses: Gather the people and I will give them water.
21:17	Then Israel sang this song: "Bring up, O well, [what you are bringing up from the valley]; sing to it.
21:18	The well which princes [Moses and Aaron] dug, which the nobles of the people hollowed by (word of) the lawgiver, [Moses] with their staff; and from the desert [it was given to them as] a gift.
21:19	And after it had been given to them, [it descended with them] to the valley, and from the valley [it ascended with them] to the heights.
21:20	And from the heights [it descended] to the valley in the field of Moav, the top of the height [(where Moses died and the well ceased flowing)], which [height] looks out on the face of Yeshimon" [lit., "the waste" (i.e., the desert)].
21:21	And Israel [i.e., Moses — the leader of the generation being "Israel" (see Deuteronomy 2:26 and Numbers 20:14)] sent messengers to Sichon, king of the Emori, saying:
21:22	Let me pass through your land [(They opened with an offer of peace though not having been commanded to do so)]; we shall not turn into field or into vineyard. We shall not drink water from the wells. On the king's way shall we go until we pass your boundary.
21:23	And Sichon did not allow Israel to pass through his boundary, and Sichon gathered together all his people, and he went out against Israel to the desert, and he came to Yahatz and he fought against Israel.
21:24	And Israel smote him with the sword and inherited his land from Arnon until Yabbok until the children of Ammon; for the boundary of the children of Ammon was strong, [fortified in the L rd's monition to Israel (Deuteronomy 2:19): "Do not besiege them (Ammon)"].
21:25	And Israel took all these cities, and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Emori in Cheshbon and in all of its neighboring villages.
21:26	For Cheshbon was the city of Sichon the king of the Emori, and he had fought against the first king of Moav and had taken all of his land from his possession until Arnon, [so that Israel was not in violation of (Deuteronomy 2:9): "Do not besiege Moav" in taking Cheshbon from Sichon.]
21:27	About this [war that Sichon waged with Moav] those who speak in parables [Bilam (see 23:7) and Beor] said [when Sichon hired Bilam to curse Moav]: Come to Cheshbon; it shall be built and established as the city of Sichon.
21:28	For a fire has gone forth from Cheshbon [after its capture by Sichon], a flame from the city of Sichon. It has consumed Ar [a province of] Moav, the possessors of the heights of Arnon.
21:29	Woe unto you, Moav! [(Bilam and Beor here cursing Moav to fall by the hand of Sichon)] You are lost, people of Kemosh [(the divinity of Moav)]. He has yielded his sons as fugitives and his daughters as captives to the king of the Emori, Sichon.
21:30	And their [Moav's] sovereignty over Cheshbon is lost; lost is [their sovereignty over] Divon, and [those who speak in parables will say]: We have laid it waste until Nofach, which reaches until Medva.
21:31	And Israel dwelt in the land of the Emori.
21:32	And Moses sent to spy out Yazer and they [the spies] took its neighboring villages [(these spies, unlike the first, relying on Moses' prayers to give them victory)], and they drove out the Emori who were there.
21:33	And they turned and went up by way of the Bashan, and Og, king of the Bashan, went out against them, he and all of his people, to do battle at Edrei.
21:34	And the L rd said to Moses: Do not fear him [Do not fear that the merit of Abraham (see Genesis 14:13) will protect him)], for I have given him into your hand, and all of his people, and his land. And you shall do to him as you did to Sichon king of the Emori who dwells at Cheshbon.
21:35	And they smote him [(Moses himself smiting Og)] and his sons and all his people, until no remnant was left of him, and they inherited his land.
22
22:1	And the children of Israel journeyed, and they encamped in the plains of Moav across the Jordan from Jericho.
Balak
22:2	And Balak the son of Tzippor saw all that Israel had done to the Emori [He said: If these two kings (Sichon and Og) on whom we relied, could not withstand them, how much more so we alone! — wherefore:]
22:3	And Moav greatly feared the people, for they were many, and Moav despaired [of their lives] before the children of Israel.
22:4	And Moav said to the elders of Midian: Now this horde will lap up everything around us as an ox laps up the greens of the field — and Balak the son of Tzippor [one of the princes of Midian] was [made] king of Moav at that time [because of the exigency of the time, though he was not of the royal line].
22:5	And he sent messengers to Bilam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people to call for him [i.e., for his (Bilam's) benefit, Balak promising to enrich him], saying: Behold, a people has gone forth from Egypt; behold, it has covered "the eye of the land" [Sichon and Moav, who were our protectors — Israel rose against them and killed them], and it abides opposite me, [against me, to cut me off].
22:6	And now, come, I pray you, and curse this people for me, for it is too strong for me. Perhaps I shall be able to smite it and drive it from the land. For I know [by your having helped Sichon to defeat Moav (see 21:27)] that what you bless is blessed and what you curse is cursed.
22:7	And the elders of Moav went, and the elders of Midian, with [all kinds of] charms in their hand [(so that Bilam not plead lack of "tools")], and they came to Bilam and they related to him the words of Balak.
22:8	And he said to them: Lodge here this night [(The Holy Spirit reposes on the prophets of the nations only at night (as one "steals into" his concubine)], and I will return to you a word, as the L rd speaks to me [(Perhaps He will consider it beneath His dignity to permit me to go with emissaries of your (lowly) rank)], and the officers of Moav abode with Bilam.
22:9	And G d came to Bilam and He said: Who are these people with you? [(G d's purpose was to delude Bilam into thinking that there were some "gaps" in His knowledge and that he might seize upon one of them to curse Israel.)]
22:10	And Bilam said to G d: Balak the son of Tzippor, the king of Moav, sent to me [(I may not "rate" with You, but I do rate with kings)]:
22:11	Behold, the people that has gone forth from Egypt and covers the eye of the land. Now, go and curse (kavah) it for me [("kavah" is more "pointed" and explicit than Balak's "arah" (6)]. Perhaps I will be able to war against it and drive it out ["of the world," whereas Balak had said (6): "and drive it from the land," Balak desiring only to free himself of them.]
22:12	And G d said to Bilam: "Do not go with them." [Bilam: "If so, I will curse them in my place."] (G d): "Do not curse the people" [Bilam: "If so, I will bless them." (G d): "They do not need your blessing], for it is blessed." ["Neither your honey nor your sting!"]
22:13	And Bilam arose in the morning and he said to the officers of Balak: Go to your land, for the L rd refuses to allow me to go with you, [but only with men of higher station, (Bilam shrouding his impotence in his arrogance)].
22:14	And the officers of Moav arose and came to Balak and they said: Bilam refuses to go with us.
22:15	And Balak sent officers yet again — more, and more honorable than these.
22:16	And they came to Bilam and said to him: Thus said Balak the son of Tzippor: Do not, I pray you, refrain from going to me.
22:17	For I will honor you greatly [(I will give you more than you were wont to receive in the past)], and whatever you tell me I will do; but go, I pray you, and curse this people for me.
22:18	And Bilam answered and said to the servants of Balak: If Balak gives me his house full of silver and gold [— and he really should, for if he hired armies, he would have to pay them; and their success is in doubt, whereas mine is assured (Bilam here "gives away" his lust for the wealth of others)], I will not be able to countermand the word of the L rd my G d to do (anything) small or great [(Bilam here perforce reveals that he is not his own master and prophesies that he will not be able to annul the L rd's blessings to the patriarchs)].
22:19	And now, abide here, I pray you — you, too [(His mouth "foiled" him — "you, too," like the first, are destined to leave in frustration)], and I shall know what more the L rd will say to me. [He will not change His blessings to curses — would that He would not bless them more! (Bilam here prophesies that He will!)]
22:20	And G d came to Bilam at night and He said to Him: If the men came to call for you [i.e., if their calling is for your benefit; if you think you can turn it toward your profit], arise and go with them, but [perforce] what I speak to you that shall you do [ — in spite of which Bilam went, hoping to "win over" the L rd].
22:21	And Bilam arose in the morning and he [himself] saddled his donkey ["Hatred undermines the proprieties"], and he went [of one accord] with the officers of Moav.
22:22	And the L rd was wroth that He went [(for though Bilam saw that G d objected (12), he persisted in going)], and an angel of the L rd [an angel of mercy] stood in the way to turn him aside [to prevent him from sinning and going lost]; and he was riding on his donkey and his two youths with him [(whence it is derived that a man of eminence going on a journey should take two men to attend him (who relieve each other in turn)].
22:23	And the donkey saw the angel of the L rd [(but Bilam did not, G d allowing animals to see more than men, who, possessing intellect, would become "unhinged" at the sight of mazzikin (destructive agents)], standing on the way with his sword drawn in his hand, and the donkey turned aside from the way and walked in the field, and Bilam struck the donkey to turn it back upon the road.
22:24	And the angel of the L rd stood in the path of the vineyards, a [stone] fence on one side and a fence on the other.
22:25	And the donkey saw the angel of the L rd, and it pinned itself against the fence, and it pinned Bilam's leg against the fence, and he struck her again.
22:26	And the angel of the L rd passed on [before him] again, and he stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn to the right or to the left.
22:27	And the donkey saw the angel of the L rd, and it sank under Bilam, and Bilam was wroth, and he struck the donkey with the rod.
22:28	And the L rd opened the donkey's mouth and it said to Bilam: What have I done to you that you have struck me this three times? [Would you uproot a nation that celebrates three times (i.e., festivals) in the year?]
22:29	And Bilam said to the donkey: Because you mocked me! Would there were a sword in my hand and I would slay you now!
22:30	And the donkey said to Bilam: Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden from the very beginning until this day? Was I ever wont to do thus unto you? And he said: No.
22:31	And the L rd uncovered Bilam's eyes, and he saw the angel of the L rd standing in the way with his sword drawn in his hand, and he bowed down and prostrated himself on his face.
22:32	And the angel of the L rd said to him: Why did you strike your donkey this three times? Behold, I went out to turn [you] aside, for [I saw that] the [goer on the] way [i.e., you] hastened [(on the way] against me [i.e., in defiance of me].
22:33	And the donkey saw me and turned aside before me this three times. Had it not turned aside before me, I would now [not only have delayed you, but] also have killed you and kept it alive, [but since it silenced you with its rebuke, I have killed it so that it not be pointed to as your "undoer" (the Holy One Blessed be He being solicitous of men's honor)].
22:34	And Bilam said to the angel of the L rd: I have sinned, for I did not know that you were standing against me on the way [(Bilam's own mouth here perforce "undoes" him — "I did not know," as opposed to (24:16): "And he (Bilam) knows, etc.")] And, now, if it is evil in your eyes, I will go back [(a "dig" at the Holy One Blessed be He, viz.: He Himself commanded me to go, and you a (mere) angel countermand His word!)]
22:35	And the angel of the L rd said to Bilam: Go with the men [("A man is led on the way he would travel")], but, perforce, the thing that I shall speak to you, that shall you speak. And Bilam went with the officers of Balak [(as happy as they to curse the Jews)].
22:36	And Balak heard [through messengers sent by Bilam] that Bilam was coming, and he went out towards him to the city [i.e., the metropolis] of Moav [(by way of saying: "See what these Jews would uproot!")] which borders on Arnon at the edge of the boundary.
22:37	And Balak said to Bilam: Did I not sent to you to call for you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not, indeed, able to honor you? [(a prophecy that Bilam is destined to depart from him in shame)]
22:38	And Bilam said to Balak: Behold, I have come to you now. Is there aught that I can speak? The thing that G d shall put in my mouth, that shall I speak.
22:39	And Bilam went with Balak, and they came to Kiryat Chutzoth [lit., "a city of (crowded) thoroughfares" — again, by way of saying: "See what the Jews would uproot!"]
22:40	And Balak slaughtered cattle and sheep [a small amount], and he sent it to Bilam and to the officers who were with him.
22:41	And it was in the morning that Balak took Bilam and he brought him up to the heights of Ba'al [his deity], and he saw from there the edge of the people (of Israel).
23
23:1	And Bilam said to Balak: Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
23:2	And Balak did as Bilam had spoken, and Balak and Bilam offered a bullock and a ram on (each) altar.
23:3	And Bilam said to Balak: Stand by your burnt-offering and I will go; perhaps the (word of) the L rd will chance to (come to) me [(He is not wont to speak with me in the daytime)], and I will tell you; and he went off alone.
23:4	And G d chanced upon Bilam [in the daytime, "grudgingly and contemptuously," and only in order to show His love for Israel]; and he said to Him: The seven altars [corresponding to the seven altars that the patriarchs arranged before You] have I arranged, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on (each) altar [whereas Abraham offered up only one ram].
23:5	And the L rd placed a word in the mouth of Bilam and He said: Return to Balak and thus shall you speak.
23:6	And he returned to him, and, behold, he was standing by his burnt-offering, he and all the officers of Moav.
23:7	And he took up his parable and he said: From Aram, Balak the king of Moav brought me, from the mountains of the east (saying to me): Go and curse (arah) Jacob for me, and go and curse (zoamah) Israel [(Balak using both terms, being uncertain as to the "lethal" form)].
23:8	When I would curse, the Almighty would not curse [(Even when they deserved to be cursed, they were not cursed (see citations in Rashi)], and when I would vent wrath, the L rd would not. [My only power is in knowing G d's "moment of wrath," and He did not manifest that moment all of these days)].
23:9	For from [their very] beginning, I behold them [fortified as] rocks [by the patriarchs and the matriarchs]; and [fortified] as mounts, I view them. Lo, the people (of Israel) shall dwell alone [in the world], and among the nations they shall not be reckoned [for destruction].
23:10	Who can count the dust [i.e., the offspring (see Genesis 13:16)] of Jacob or the number of [one of] the four [banners of the encampments of] Israel? Let my soul die the death of the righteous [among them] and let my last end be like theirs.
23:11	And Balak said to Bilam: What did you do to me? To curse my foes did I take you, and, behold, you have blessed them!
23:12	And he answered and said: Must I not take heed to speak that which the L rd places in my mouth?
23:13	And Balak said to him: Come, I pray you, with me to another place whence you will see them. But only their outermost part will you see, and you will not see all of them; and curse them for me from there.
23:14	And he took him to the field of the scouts, to the top of the height [Balak divined that a breach would break forth in Israel there and assumed it to be the effect of the curse (whereas, in reality, the "breach" was Moses' dying there)]; and he built seven altars, and he offered up a bullock and a ram on (each) altar.
23:15	And he said to Balak: Stand here by your burnt-offering, and I will be chanced upon here [by the Holy One Blessed be He].
23:16	And the L rd chanced upon Bilam, and He placed a word in his mouth, [as one places a bit in an animal's mouth (Bilam balking at what he now saw to be a futile errand, and the L rd "bridling" him to His will)], and He said: Return to Balak, and thus shall you speak.
23:17	And he came to him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt-offering, and [some of] the officers of Moav with him, [but not all of them (as opposed to (6), some of them having lost hope in him and having left)]. And Balak said to him [mockingly]: What did the L rd (but not "you") speak? [you being nothing but His mouthpiece]
23:18	And he took up his parable and he said: Arise, Balak [(This is Bilam's "riposte" to Balak's mockery — Stand! You have no right to sit when being addressed by G d's emissary!)]; give ear to me, son of Tzippor!
23:19	The Almighty is not a man that He should deceive [(He has sworn to give them the land, and do you think to slay them in the desert)]; nor the son of man, that He should retract. Would He say and not do? [Would He] speak and not fulfill?
23:20	Behold, [a fiat] to bless [them] have I received [from Him], and He has blessed [them], and I will not reverse it.
23:21	He does not scrutinize [exactingly] the iniquity [that is] in Jacob, and He does not see the toil [i.e., the toilsome transgression] [that is] in Israel. The L rd, his G d, is with him, [not leaving them even when they are rebellious], and the King's love is in him.
23:22	The Almighty brought them forth from Egypt [(as opposed to your: "A people has gone forth from Egypt" (22:5)]; and the flight of the heights is His.
23:23	[They are worthy of blessing] for there is no [practice of] enchantment in Jacob, and there is no divination in Israel. [There is destined to come] a time like this [when His love for them will be revealed, when they are seated within the Divine partition and] it will be asked of Jacob and of Israel: "What hath the Almighty wrought?"
23:24	Behold, a people that rises like a lioness [in the morning from their sleep to "snatch" mitzvoth] and which lifts itself up as a lion. It does not lie down [to sleep] until [by the reading of the Shema] it consumes its prey, [all of the mazzikin (destructive agents) which come to assail them], and [when armies come against them, the L rd protects them and fights their wars], and it drinks the blood of the slain.
23:25	And Balak said to Bilam: Neither curse them nor bless them!
23:26	And Bilam answered and said to Balak: Did I not tell you: All that the L rd speaks, that will I do?
23:27	And Balak said to Bilam: Come, I pray you, let me take you to another place. Perhaps it will be right in the eyes of G d, and you will curse them for me from there.
23:28	And Balak took Bilam to the top of Peor, which looks out upon the face of the wilderness. [Balak divined that Israel would be smitten by Peor and assumed the (prospective) curse to be the cause.]
23:29	And Bilam said to Balak: Build for me here seven altars and prepare for me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
23:30	And Balak did as Bilam said, and he offered up a bullock and a ram upon (each) altar.
24
24:1	And Bilam saw that it was good in the eyes of the L rd to bless Israel, and he did not go, as [he had gone] twice before to diviners [to divine whether the L rd would "chance upon" him as he wished; but he said to himself: Whether or not He wishes to curse them, I shall mention their sins and the curse will perforce alight upon them], and he set his face to the desert [to the sin of the golden calf that Israel had made there].
24:2	And Bilam lifted his eyes [seeking to cast the "evil eye" upon them], and he saw Israel dwelling according to its tribes, [each tribe by itself, and the doors of their tents non-aligned, so that none look into his neighbor's tent], and the spirit of G d reposed upon him. [It entered his heart not to curse them.]
24:3	And he took up his parable and he said: The speech of Bilam the son of Beor and the speech of the man of the gouged-out eye.
24:4	The speech of the hearer of the words of the Almighty, who sees the vision of the Almighty, fallen [on his bed at night] and his eyes uncovered [(Bilam being granted prophecy only at night)]:
24:5	How goodly are your tents, O Jacob, [the tent-entrances not being aligned with one another], your dwelling places [i.e., your encampments], O Israel!
24:6	As brooks which stretch out [into the distance], as gardens by the river, as the aloes planted by the L rd [in the garden of Eden], as cedar trees by the waters.
24:7	Water shall flow from his springs [i.e., the king issuing from his sons shall flourish], and his seed in many waters [i.e., his seed will prosper], and his [first] king (Saul) will be exalted above [i.e., he will vanquish] Agag [the king of Amalek], and his [Jacob's] kingdom will rise [ever higher, (David and Solomon following Saul)].
24:8	[Who accorded this greatness to them?] The Almighty who brought them forth from Egypt [with His strength and grandeur]. The flight of the heights is His. He shall devour the nations, his oppressors, and their bones shall he strip clean, and he shall dye His arrows [in their blood.]
24:9	He shall crouch and lie down as a lion [i.e., They will settle their land in strength and might], and as a lioness — Who shall make him rise? Those who bless you will be blessed, and those who curse you will be cursed.
24:10	And Balak's anger burned against Bilam and he smote his hands together and Balak said to Bilam: To curse my foes did I call you, and here you have blessed them this three times!
24:11	And now, flee to your place. I said that I would honor you, but the L rd has withheld you from honor.
24:12	And Bilam said to Balak: Did I not also speak to your messengers that you sent to me, saying:
24:13	If Balak gives me his house full of silver and gold, I will not be able to countermand the word of the L rd [(Here he omits "my G d," as opposed to 22:18, knowing that he has been rejected and "cast out" by Him)] to do good or evil as I wish? What the L rd speaks, that will I speak.
24:14	And now, behold, I go to my people, [to be as one of them (the L rd having left him)]. Come, I will counsel you [what to do to them — to undo them by harlotry (see 31:16). And I shall reveal to you] what this people will do to your people in the end of days [viz., 17].
24:15	And he took up his parable and he said: The speech of Bilam the son of Beor and the speech of the man of the gouged-out eye.
24:16	The speech of the hearer of the words of the Almighty, and the knower of the knowledge of the Most High [(in that he can determine the time of His anger)]. He sees the vision of the Almighty, fallen and his eyes uncovered [see 4].
24:17	I see it [the greatness of Jacob], but [it is] not now [but after a time]; I behold it, but [it is] not near. A star [i.e., a king] will arise from Jacob, and a sceptre [i.e., a ruling king] will arise from Israel, and he [David] shall smite the edges of Moav [See II Samuel 8:2] and he shall dig through all the sons of Sheth [i.e., the nations].
24:18	And Edom will be a possession [to Israel], and Seir will be a possession [to Israel] his enemies, and Israel will do valiantly.
24:19	And there will be [yet another] ruler [the Messiah] from Jacob, and he will destroy the remnant [of Edom] from [its capital] city [Rome].
24:20	And he saw [the retribution of] Amalek, and he took up his parable and he said: The first of nations [to war against Israel] was Amalek, and his end is to perish everlastingly [through them].
24:21	And he saw the Keini [(the grandeur of the descendants of Yithro. See I Chronicles 2:55. Having just spoken of Amalek, he now speaks of the Keini, who were situated in their midst (I Samuel 15:6)], and he took up his parable and he said: [I wonder how you have attained to this. Were you (Yithro) not together with me in the counsel against Israel? (Exodus 1:10), and now] your dwelling place is firm [within the stronghold of Israel] and you have set your nest in the rock!
24:22	[Fortunate are you in having joined yourself to this strength, for you will thus never be driven from the world]; for though Kayin (i.e., the Keini) be destined to be removed [into exile together with the ten tribes, what of it?] How far will Ashur carry you into captivity? [To Chalach or to Chavor? This is not extinction but removal, and you will return with the other exiles.]
24:23	And he took up his parable and he said: [(Having mentioned Ashur's conquest, he now says)] Woe, who shall live [i.e., Who shall escape] from the Placer of these [decreeing the same things against him!]
24:24	[For Sancherev (Ashur) will arise and confound the nations,] and, [thereafter,] great ships shall come from Kittim and they [the Romans] shall afflict Ashur, and they will afflict [those] beyond [the Euphrates], but he, too, [i.e., the Romans] shall perish everlastingly [See Daniel 7:11].
24:25	And Bilam arose and went and returned to his place, and Balak, too, went on his way.
25
25:1	And Israel dwelt in Shittim, and the people began to stray after the daughters of Moav [(a result of Bilam's counsel)].
25:2	And they [the Moavite women] called the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate, and they bowed down to their gods [(the Moavite women making this a condition for their consenting)].
25:3	And Israel joined itself to Ba'al Peor (the idolatry of Moav) [so called because they exposed (pa'aru) themselves and defecated before it (this being its mode of worship)], and the L rd was wroth with Israel. [He sent a plague against them.]
25:4	And the L rd said to Moses: Take all the heads of the people [to judge the worshippers of Peor] and hang them [the worshippers] up to the L rd [after stoning them (all who are executed by stoning being hanged thereafter)] in the face of the sun [i.e., before all] so that the wrath of the L rd turn away from Israel.
25:5	And Moses said to the judges [88,000] of Israel: Slay each (of you) his [two] men that have joined themselves to Ba'al Peor.
25:6	And, behold, a man of the children of Israel [Zimri, chief of the tribe of Shimon] came, and he brought near to his brothers the Midianite woman [Kazbi, the daughter of Tzur] in the sight of Moses and in the sight of the entire congregation of the children of Israel, and they wept at the door of the tent of meeting [(at Moses' seeming impotence to stand up against one man whereas in the incident of the golden calf he had stood up against six hundred thousand! (For a full account of what transpired here see Sanhedrin 82a)]
25:7	And Pinchas, the son of Elazar, the son of Aaron the Cohein, saw [the act, and he remembered the halachah (that zealots may kill one they see cohabiting with an Aramite woman)], and he arose from the midst of the congregation and he took a spear in his hand.
25:8	And he came after the man of Israel to the tent and he thrust both of them through, the man of Israel [precisely through his genitals] and the woman [precisely] through her genitals [so that all see that he had not slain them for nought], and the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.
25:9	And the dead in the plague were twenty-four thousand.
Pinchas
25:10	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
25:11	Pinchas, the son of Elazar, the son of Aaron the Cohein, [(Because the tribes denigrated Pinchas — "Did you see the son of this Puti (short for Putiel (Exodus 6:25), whose mother's father (Yithro) fattened (pitem) calves for idolatry, who killed the chief (Zimri) of a tribe of Israel!" — Scripture took pains to trace his genealogy to Aaron)], (Pinchas) turned My wrath away from the children of Israel when he raged My rage [i.e., when he executed vengeance on My behalf] in their midst, and I did not consume the children of Israel in My wrath.
25:12	Therefore, say: Behold, I give to him My covenant [to be unto him a covenant of] peace.
25:13	And it shall be unto him and to his seed after him a covenant of eternal priesthood [(Prior to this, the priesthood had been given only to Aaron and his sons who were anointed with him and to their sons born thereafter, but Pinchas had been born before)] — because he was wroth for his G d and he atoned for the children of Israel.
25:14	And the name of the man of Israel who was smitten, who was smitten together with the Midianite woman, was Zimri the son of Salu [(As the righteous one is cited for commendation, the wicked one is cited for condemnation)], chief of a father's house [one of the five] in the house of Shimon.
25:15	And the name of the woman who was smitten, the Midianitess, was Kazbi the daughter of Tzur; head of the peoples [chief of the five kings of Midian], of a father's house [one of the five] in Midian was he [ — in spite of which, the Midianites, in their fierce hatred of Israel, consigned her to harlotry].
25:16	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
25:17	Afflict the Midianites and smite them.
25:18	For they afflict you with their schemes which they have schemed against you in the cause of Peor, [consigning their daughters to harlotry to turn you to Peor worship], and in the cause of Kazbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, who was smitten in the day of the plague in the cause of Peor.
26
26:1	And it was, after the plague, ["the Shepherd counting his surviving sheep after the wolf raid"], that the L rd said to Moses and to Elazar the son of Aaron the Cohein, saying:
26:2	Take the count of the entire congregation of the children of Israel from twenty years and above by their fathers' house [(the tribes being reckoned according to the fathers and not according to the mothers)], all who go to war in Israel.
26:3	And Moses and Elazar the Cohein spoke with them [of G d's having commanded to count them], in the plains of Moav by the Jordan (near) Jericho, saying:
26:4	[You must be counted] from twenty years and above, as the L rd commanded Moses and the children of Israel who went out of the land of Egypt [to be counted thus (Exodus 30:14)].
26:5	Reuven, the first-born of Israel, the sons of Reuven: Chanoch, the family of the Chanochi (hachanochi) [All of the family names are similarly structured (with the heh and the yod), intimating (Psalms 122:4): "The tribes of Kah ('the L rd') testimony to Israel" — G d Himself testifying to the (tribal) paternity of Israel (in rebuttal to those who would cast doubt upon it in view of their having been enslaved by the Egyptians)]; Falu, the family of the Palui,
26:6	Chetzron, the family of the Chetzroni; Karmi, the family of the Karmi.
26:7	These are the families of the Reuveni. And their number was forty-three thousand and seven hundred and thirty.
26:8	And the sons of Falu, Eliav.
26:9	And the sons of Eliav: Nemuel and Dathan and Aviram. This is the Dathan and Aviram, the "called" of the congregation [see 1:16], who incited [Israel] against Moses and Aaron in the congregation of Korach when they incited [Israel] against the L rd.
26:10	And the earth opened its mouth and it swallowed them and Korach in the death of the congregation (of Korach) when the fire consumed the two hundred and fifty men, and they became a sign [for G d's having established the priesthood (with Aaron and his sons)].
26:11	And the sons of Korach did not die [(Though in the plot at the outset, they repented in their hearts, so that a high place was bastioned for them in Gehinnom, where they abided.)]
26:12	The sons of Shimon, according to their families: Nemuel, the family of the Nemueli; Yamin, the family of the Yamini; Yachin, the family of the Yachini.

26:36	And these are the sons of Shuthalach: Eran, the family of the Erani [The offspring of the other sons of Shuthelach were called by his name. Because the family of Eran was exceptionally large, they are called by his name.]
26:37	These are the families of the sons of Ephraim by their numbers, thirty-two thousand and five hundred. These are the sons of Joseph according to their families.
26:38	The sons of Binyamin, according to their families: Bela, the family of the Bal'i; Ashbel, the family of the Ashbeli; Achiram, the family of the Achirami [Achiram is the same as Echi (Genesis 46:21). Because he was named after Joseph, Binyamin's brother, he was called "Achi (my brother) ram" (high, i.e., greater than I)].
26:39	Shefufam, the family of the Shufami [the same as Mupim (Genesis 46:21), Joseph being downtrodden (shafuf) by the peoples], Chufam, the family of the Chufami.

26:42	These are the sons of Dan according to their families: Shucham, [the same as Chushim (Genesis 46:23)], the family of the Shuchami. These are the families of Dan by their families.
26:43	All the families of the Shuchami by their numbered ones, sixty-four thousand and four hundred.
26:44	The sons of Asher, according to their families: Yimnah, the family of the Yimnah; Yishvi, the family of the Yishvi; Beriah, the family of the Beri'i.
26:45	The sons of Beriah: Chever, the family of the Chevri; Malkiel, the family of the Malkieli.
26:46	And the name of the daughter of Asher was Sarach [(Because she was still alive, she is mentioned here)].
26:47	These are the families of the sons of Asher by their numbered ones, fifty-three thousand and four hundred.
26:48	The sons of Naftali, according to their families: Yachtze'el, the family of the Yachtze'eli; Guni, the family of the Guni.
26:49	Yetzer, the family of the Yitzri; Shilem, the family of the Shilemi.
26:50	These are the families of Naftali according to their families; and their numbered ones, forty-five thousand and four hundred.
26:51	These are the numbered ones of the children of Israel, six hundred and one thousand and seven hundred and thirty.
26:52	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
26:53	To these shall the land be apportioned, [and not to those younger than twenty, even if they reached that age by the time of the division of the land], as an inheritance according to the number of names.
26:54	To the [more] numerous [tribe] you shall increase its inheritance [i.e., you shall give it a larger portion], and to the less [numerous] you shall decrease its inheritance. To each, according to his numbers shall his inheritance be given.
26:55	Only [(excluding Joshua and Calev, who received special portions)] by lot shall the land be divided, [the lot actually calling out the correct division through the Holy Spirit.] By the names of the tribes of their fathers [(proselytes and slaves hereby excluded), who came out of Egypt] shall they inherit [e.g., If two brothers who left Egypt had sons entering the land — the first, one son; the second, three — (the one son takes one portion; the three, three (as per verse 53), after which their portions revert to their fathers' father (as per verse 55), so that they (the two fathers) divide (four portions) equally.]
26:56	By the word of the lot [("word," literally, see above)] shall its inheritance be divided between the many and the few.
26:57	And these are the numbered of the Levites, according to their families: Gershon, the family of the Gershuni; Kehath, the family of the Kehathi; Merari, the family of the Merari.
26:58	These are the families of Levi [see Exodus 16-19]: the family of the Livni, the family of the Chevroni, the family of the Machli, the family of the Mushi, the family of the Karchi; and Kehath begot Amram.
26:59	And the name of the wife of Amram was Yocheved the daughter of Levi, who (i.e., whose wife) bore her to Levi in Egypt, [just as they entered Egypt (so that she makes up the complement of the "seventy souls" who entered Egypt (Genesis 46:27)]. And she bore to Amram: Aaron and Moses, and Miriam, their sister.
26:60	And there was born to Aaron: Nadav and Avihu, Elazar and Ithamar.
26:61	And Nadav and Avihu died when they offered strange fire before the L rd.
26:62	And their (the Levites') numbered ones were twenty-three thousand, every male from one month and above. For they were not numbered in the midst of the children of Israel [from the age of twenty]; for an inheritance was not given them [as it was to all those over twenty] in the midst of the children of Israel.
26:63	These are the numbered ones of Moses and Elazar the Cohein, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moav by the Jordan (near) Jericho.
26:64	And among these there was not a man of those that had been counted by Moses and Aaron the Cohein, who had counted the children of Israel in the desert of Sinai. [(But the decree of the spies had not gone forth against the women, who, unlike the men, who wished to return to Egypt, desired a holding in the land (for which reason the episode of the daughters of Tzelafchad follows)].
26:65	For the L rd had said to them: They will surely die in the desert. And there was left not a man of them except Calev the son of Yefuneh and Joshua the son of Nun.
27
27:1	And there drew near the daughters of Tzelafchad, the son of Chefer, the son of Gilad, the son of Machir, the son of Menasheh, of the families of Menasheh the son of Joseph. [Just as Joseph held Eretz Yisrael dear (viz., Genesis 50:25), so did the daughters of Tzelafchad (viz., 4 following). And all of them were righteous (their pedigree being traced back to Joseph, the tzaddik)]. And these are the names of his daughters: Machlah, Noah, Chaglah, Milkah, and Tirtzah.
27:2	And they stood [in the house of study] before Moses and before Elazar the Cohein [(This occurred in the fortieth year, after Aaron had died)] and before the leaders and the entire congregation at the door of the tent of meeting, saying:
27:3	Our father died in the desert, and he was not in the midst of the congregation that gathered against the L rd [i.e., the cavilers (Exodus 16:2), and not] in the congregation of Korach, [who incited to rebellion], but he died in his own sin, [without inciting others to sin], and he left no sons.
27:4	Why should the name of our father be withheld from his family because he has no son? [We stand in place of a son. And if females are not considered seed, let our mother perform levirate marriage (yibum)! ("because he has no son":) If he had a son they would claim nothing (They were sage women)]. Give us a holding in the midst of the brothers of our father.
27:5	And Moses brought forth their judgment before the L rd. [The halachah evaded him — retribution for his "presumptuousness," viz. (Deuteronomy 1:17): "And the thing that is too difficult for you, you shall bring near to me."]
27:6	And the L rd said to Moses, saying:
27:7	Rightly do the daughters of Tzelafchad speak. [Thus is this section (of inheritance) written before Me on high.] Given shall be given to them [(two portions — that of their father, who was among those who left Egypt, and that of his brothers in the property of Chefer (his father, who was also one of those who left Egypt)] the holding of an inheritance in the midst of the brothers of their father, and you shall pass over (veha'avarta) [(an expression of wrath (evrah), directed against one who does not leave over a son to inherit him)] the inheritance of their father to them.
27:8	And to the children of Israel shall you speak, saying: A man, if he die and he have no son, then you shall pass over his inheritance to his daughter.
27:9	And if he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.
27:10	And if he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to the brothers of his father.
27:11	And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his flesh who is near to him of his family [("family" denotes his father's side)], and he shall inherit it, and it shall be to the children of Israel a statute of judgment as the L rd commanded Moses.
27:12	And the L rd said to Moses: Go up to this Mount Avarim and see the land that I gave to the children of Israel. [(The rationale of the juxtaposition: When the L rd told Moses to give the daughters of Tzelafchad an inheritance, he felt that the decree against his entering the land might have been rescinded — whereupon he was apprised otherwise.)]
27:13	And you shall see it and you, too, shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was gathered [(whence it is seen that Moses aspired to a death like Aaron's)].
27:14	[This, your death, was decreed] when you flouted My command in the desert of Tzin, in the contention of the congregation, (My command) to sanctify Me with the waters before their eyes. They [(the waters alone, and no egregious sin, were the cause of their death in the desert)], the waters of Merivath-Kadesh, in the desert of Tzin.
27:15	And Moses spoke to the L rd [(When the righteous leave the world, they put aside their own needs in favor of communal needs)] to say [i.e., to tell him whether or not He would appoint a leader for them.)]
27:16	[When Moses was told to give Tzelafchad's inheritance to his daughters, he felt that the time was ripe to ask that his sons inherit his greatness — whereupon he said:] Let the L rd, the G d of the spirits of all flesh appoint a man over the congregation [(You know that the minds of all men are different. Appoint for them a leader who can tolerate all of these minds)]
27:17	who will go out before them (to war) [(Not like the kings of the nations, who sit at home and send their armies to war, but like me (and like Joshua and David), who fought in the vanguard)], and who will come in before them [at their head], and who will take them out [in his merits], and who will bring them back [in his merits]. And let the congregation of the L rd not be as sheep without a shepherd.
27:18	And the L rd said to Moses: [Not as you think, but] take for yourself Joshua the son of Nun [(because "he never departed from the tent" (Exodus 33:11) — "The keeper of the fig tree shall eat its fruit" (Proverbs 27:18)], a man who has spirit in him [(as per your request (16)], and place your hand upon him [Give him an interpreter to expound (Torah) in your lifetime, so that people not say about him (after your death): "He would never dare do this in Moses' lifetime!"]
27:19	And stand him before Elazar the Cohein and before the entire congregation, and charge him [over Israel] before their eyes. [Impress it upon him that he is accepting the charge with full knowledge of their bothersomeness and refractoriness.]
27:20	And you shall place [some] of your glory ["shining of countenance"] upon him, so that all the congregation of the children of Israel pay heed [to honor and fear him, as they do you.]
27:21	And before Elazar the Cohein shall he stand [(an accession to Moses' request that all his honor not depart from his father's house — Joshua, too, having need of Elazar)], and he (Joshua) shall inquire of him [when there is a need to go out to war] as to the judgment of the urim before the L rd. By his [Elazar's] word shall they go out, and by his word shall they come in, he (Joshua) and all the children of Israel with him, and the entire congregation [the Sanhedrin].
27:22	And Moses did as the L rd commanded him, and he "took" Joshua [with words, apprising him of the reward of the leaders of Israel in the world to come], and he charged him before Elazar the Cohein and before the entire congregation.
27:23	And he placed his hands upon him [(being even more profuse in the conferring of his wisdom than he had been commanded, viz. (18) "Place your hand upon him")], and he charged him, as the L rd had spoken [(even in respect to the glory" (20) — he imparted of his glory to him)] by the hand of Moses.
28
28:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
28:2	Command the children of Israel [(Before commanding Me for My children, viz. (16): "Let the L rd appoint a man, etc.," command My children for Me!")], and say to them: My offering [the blood], My bread [the devoted portions (see Leviticus 3:16)], for My fires [i.e., which are placed on the fires of My altar], (for) My sweet savor shall you observe [(whence is derived the institution of ma'amadoth ("watches"), Cohanim, Levites, and Israelites standing over the sacrifices)] to offer to Me in its appointed time [(Every day is the "appointed time" of the temidim (the continual offerings)].
28:3	And you shall say to them [This is an exhortation to beth-din (to charge the people)]: This is the fire-offering which you shall offer up to the L rd: lambs of the first year, unblemished, two each day [(each to be slaughtered opposite the "day," i.e., the sun; the morning tamid in the west, and the evening tamid in the east)], a perpetual burnt-offering.
28:4	The one lamb shall you offer in the morning, and the other lamb shall you offer towards evening. [Even though this was already stated (Exodus 29:38), there it was an exhortation for the days of investiture (of the Cohanim), whereas here it is commanded for all time.]
28:5	And a tenth of an ephah of flour for the meal-offering [the libation meal-offering] mixed with oil of crushing (see Exodus 29:40), a fourth of a hin.
28:6	A perpetual burnt-offering [like those] offered up [in the days of the investiture] at Mount Sinai, as a sweet savor, a fire-offering to the L rd.
28:7	And its [wine] libation, a fourth of a hin for the one lamb. On the holy place [i.e., the altar] shall it be poured, a pouring of strong [intoxicating] drink [as opposed to wine straight from the press] to the L rd.
28:8	And the second lamb shall you offer up towards evening. As the meal-offering of the morning and its libation shall you offer it; a fire-offering, a sweet savor [i.e., gratifying] to the L rd [in that His will was done].
28:9	And on the Sabbath day, two lambs of the first year without blemish and two tenth measures of flour for a meal-offering, mixed with oil and its libation.
28:10	The burnt-offering of the Sabbath in its Sabbath [(and not the burnt-offering of this Sabbath on another Sabbath ["The day being past, its offering is annulled")], in addition to the daily burnt-offering and its libation. [(These are the mussafim, the "additional" offerings, which are to be offered between the two daily offerings.)]
28:11	And in the beginning of your months, you shall offer a burnt-offering to the L rd: two young bullocks, one ram, seven one-year-old lambs, unblemished.
28:12	And three esronim of flour for a meal-offering, [as with the fixed libations for a bullock (15:9)], mixed with oil for the one bullock, and two esronim of flour for a meal-offering, mixed with oil for the one ram.
28:13	And issaron, issaron of flour for a meal-offering, mixed with oil, for the one lamb, for a burnt-offering, a sweet savor, a fire-offering to the L rd.
28:14	And their libations: half a hin for the bullock, a third of a hin for the ram, a fourth of a hin for the lamb, wine. This is the burnt-offering of the month in its month [(If the day passes, the offering is annulled and there is no restitution)], for the months of the year.
28:15	And one kid of goats as a sin-offering to the L rd [i.e., where only the L rd knows of the sin — this, in atonement for defiling the sanctuary or its objects without awareness of having done so (this offering serving as the prototype for all of the additional goat offerings (mussafim) as effecting such atonement)]; in addition to the continual burnt-offering shall it [the complete offering (not just the kid)] be offered, with its [the offering's (not the kid's)] libation.
28:16	And in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, it is Pesach to the L rd.
28:17	And on the fifteenth day of this month, it is a festival; for seven days matzoth shall be eaten.
28:18	On the first day it is a calling of holiness; all work of labor you shall not do [(Even essential work, which cannot be made up, which is permitted on Chol Hamoed, is forbidden on Yom Tov)].
28:19	And you shall present a fire-offering, a burnt-offering to the L rd, two young bullocks [(in commemoration of the bullock of Abraham (Genesis 18:7)], one ram [(in commemoration of the ram of Isaac (Ibid. 22:13)], and seven one-year-old lambs [(in commemoration of Jacob (Ibid. 30:40)]; unblemished shall they be to you.
28:20	And their meal-offering, flour mixed with oil, three esronim for the bullock and two esronim for the ram shall you offer it.
28:21	Issaron, issaron shall you offer for the one lamb, for the seven lambs.
28:22	And one kid as a sin-offering to atone for you.
28:23	Aside from the burnt-offering of the morning of the daily burnt-offering shall you offer these.
28:24	As these shall you offer each day [(They are not to decrease progressively as the bullocks of Succoth)] for seven days, the food of a fire-offering, a sweet savor to the L rd; in addition to the continual burnt-offering shall it be offered, and its libation.
28:25	And on the seventh day, a calling of holiness shall it be for you; all work of labor you shall not do.
28:26	And on the day of first-fruits [(Shavuoth is designated as the "first" of the wheat harvest (Exodus 34:22) by reason of the two loaves (Leviticus 23:17), the first of the wheaten meal-offerings brought from the new grain)], when you offer a new meal-offering to the L rd in (the completion of) your weeks (see Leviticus 23:15), a calling of holiness shall it be for you; all work of labor you shall not do.
28:27	And you shall present a burnt-offering, as a sweet savor to the L rd, two young bullocks, one ram, and seven one-year-old lambs.
28:28	And their meal-offering: flour mixed with oil, three esronim for the one bullock, two esronim for the one ram.
28:29	Issaron, issaron for the one lamb, for the seven lambs.
28:30	One kid of goats to atone for you.
28:31	Aside from the continual burnt-offering and its meal-offering shall you offer (them). Unblemished shall they be for you, and their libations. [Their libations, too, shall be unblemished — whence it is derived that mouldy wine is invalid.]
29
29:1	And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, there shall be unto you a calling of holiness. All work of labor you shall not do; a day of teruah (blowing the shofar) shall it be for you.
29:2	And you shall offer a burnt-offering as a sweet savor to the L rd: one young bullock, one ram, seven one-year-old lambs, unblemished.
29:3	And their meal-offering: flour mixed with oil, three esronim for the bullock, two esronim for the ram.
29:4	And one issaron for the one lamb, for the seven lambs.
29:5	And one kid of goats to atone for you.
29:6	Aside from the burnt-offering of the month [the mussafim of Rosh Chodesh of Rosh Hashanah] and its meal-offering and the continual burnt-offering and its meal-offering, and their libations as prescribed, as a sweet savor, a fire-offering to the L rd.
29:7	And on the tenth (day) of this seventh month, a calling of holiness shall there be for you, and you shall afflict your souls; all labor you shall not do.
29:8	And you shall present a burnt-offering to the L rd, a sweet savor, one young bullock, one ram, seven one-year-old lambs; unblemished shall they be to you.
29:9	And their meal-offering: flour mixed with oil, three esronim for the bullock, two esronim for the one ram.
29:10	Issaron, issaron for the one lamb, for the seven lambs.
29:11	One kid of goats as a sin-offering, aside from the sin-offering of atonement [the goat offered within the holy of holies (Leviticus 16:9)] and the continual burnt-offering and its meal-offering [shall you offer these burnt-offerings], and [you shall offer] their libations [those of the aforementioned mussafim (8)].
29:12	And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, a calling of holiness shall there be for you; all work of labor you shall not do, and you shall celebrate a festival to the L rd, seven days.
29:13	And you shall present a burnt-offering, a fire-offering, a sweet savor to the L rd, thirteen young bullocks, two rams, fourteen one-year-old lambs; unblemished shall they be.
29:14	And their meal-offering: flour mixed with oil, three esronim for the one bullock, for the thirteen bullocks, two esronim for the one ram, for the two rams.
29:15	And issaron, issaron for the one lamb, for the fourteen lambs.
29:16	And one kid of goats for a sin-offering, aside from the continual burnt-offering, its meal-offering, and its libation.
29:17	And on the second day, twelve young bullocks, two rams, fourteen one-year-old lambs, unblemished.
29:18	And their meal-offering and their libations: for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, as prescribed. [The seventy bullocks of the Succoth festival correspond to the seventy nations, their progressive diminution during the festival alluding to the ultimate destruction of the nations. The lambs correspond to Israel, which is called "a scattered lamb" (Jeremiah 50:17). Their number is fixed, and their total (ninety-eight) alludes to their serving to avert the ninety-eight curses of the book of Deuteronomy. The three variant letters (mem in veniskeihem (19), yod in unesachehah (31), and mem in kemishpatam (33), spell out "mayim" (water), an allusion to the water libation on Succoth.)]
29:19	And one kid of goats for a sin-offering, aside from the continual burnt-offering and its meal-offering and their libations.
29:20	And on the third day, eleven bullocks, two rams, fourteen one-year-old lambs, unblemished.
29:21	And their meal-offering and their libations: for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, as prescribed.
29:22	And one kid for a sin-offering, aside from the continual burnt-offering and its meal-offering and its libation.
29:23	And on the fourth day, ten bullocks, two rams, fourteen one-year-old lambs, unblemished.
29:24	Their meal-offering and their libations: for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, as prescribed.
29:25	And one kid of goats for a sin-offering, aside from the continual burnt-offering, its meal-offering, and its libation.
29:26	And on the fifth day, nine bullocks, two rams, fourteen one-year-old lambs, unblemished.
29:27	And their meal-offering and their libations: for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, as prescribed.
29:28	And one kid for a sin-offering, aside from the continual burnt-offering and its meal-offering and its libation.
29:29	And on the sixth day, eight bullocks, two rams, fourteen one-year-old lambs, unblemished.
29:30	And their meal-offerings and their libations: for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, as prescribed.
29:31	And one kid for a sin-offering, aside from the continual burnt-offering, its meal-offering, and its libations.
29:32	And on the seventh day, seven bullocks, two rams, fourteen one-year-old lambs, unblemished.
29:33	And their meal-offering and their libations: for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, as prescribed for them.
29:34	And one kid for a sin-offering, aside from the continual burnt-offering, its meal-offering, and its libation.
29:35	On the eighth day, a withholding [from work] shall there be for you; all work of labor you shall not do.
29:36	And you shall present a burnt-offering, a fire-offering, a sweet savor to the L rd, one bullock, one ram, seven one-year-old lambs, unblemished. [These ("one bullock, etc.") vis-à-vis Israel, the L rd, as it were, telling His children before they depart from Him: "Abide with Me yet another day."]
29:37	Their meal-offering and their libations: for the bullock, for the ram, and for the lambs, according to their number, as prescribed.
29:38	And one kid for a sin-offering, aside from the continual burnt-offering, and its meal-offering and its libation.
29:39	These [fixed offerings] shall you offer to the L rd on your festivals, aside from your vows and your gift-offerings [(If you wish to offer such on the festival, it is "a mitzvah come to hand"; or, your vows or gift-offerings pledged during the year — offer them on the festival (lest you find it difficult to return and offer them and be in transgression of (Deuteronomy 23:22): "You shall not delay, etc.")] for your burnt-offerings, and your meal-offerings, and your libations, and your peace-offerings.
30
30:1	And Moses related (it) to the children of Israel, as all that the L rd had commanded Moses, [viz. 28:2 (This is stated here to obviate the impression that Moses did not tell it to them but proceeded directly to the section that follows.)]
Matoth
30:2	And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel [(according them honor by instructing them first, and then instructing the children of Israel (this being stated here specifically in respect to vows though it was the mode for all teachings (see Exodus 34:31-32), in order to teach that the annulment of vows is effected by one expert (in vows), or, in his absence, by three non-experts)], saying: This is the thing that the L rd has commanded.
30:3	A man, if he vow a vow to the L rd [(not to eat something or not to do something)], or if he take an oath to bind a bond upon his soul [i.e., to forbid to himself something which is permitted (but not, to permit to himself something which is forbidden)], he shall not profane his word. According to all that issues from his mouth shall he do.
30:4	And a woman, if she vow a vow to the L rd and bind a bond (see above) in her father's house [(i.e., when she is under her father's authority)], in her maidenhood, [after twelve years and one day, (and not when she is a minor, in which instance her vow is not a vow, nor when she is a bogereth (after maidenhood), in which instance she is not under her father's authority for him to annul her vow)],
30:5	And her father hear her vow and her bond wherewith she bound her soul, and her father be silent to her, then all of her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
30:6	And if her father constrain her [i.e., if he annuls her vow] on the day that he hears, then all her vows and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall not stand, and the L rd shall forgive her, for her father has constrained her. [(Scripture speaks of a woman whose husband, unknown to her, had annulled a vow of Naziritism that he had heard her make, and who had violated her vow by drinking wine or by becoming unclean to the dead. Though the vow is annulled, she requires forgiveness. (How much more so, one whose vow was not annulled!)]
30:7	And if she be [betrothed] to a man, and her vows [that she vowed in her father's house] be upon her, [her father not having heard them, so that they were neither annulled nor confirmed, (annulment being effected only jointly, by her father and her betrothed)], or the utterance of her lips wherewith she bound her soul,
30:8	And her husband [i.e., her betrothed] hear, on the day that he hear, and he be silent to her, then her vows shall stand, and her bonds with which she bound her soul shall stand.
30:9	And if on the day that her husband hear, he constrain her and annul [(jointly, with her father)] her vow which is upon her and the utterance of her lips wherewith she bound her soul, then the L rd shall forgive her.
30:10	And the vow of a widow [from marriage (as opposed to a widow from betrothal, in which instance she returns to her father's authority)] or of a divorced woman — everything wherewith she binds her soul shall stand with her.
30:11	And if in the house of her husband [in marriage (as opposed to betrothal)] she vowed, or bound her soul with a bond by swearing,
30:12	And her husband heard and was silent to her and did not constrain her, then all of her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
30:13	And if her husband annul them on the day of his hearing, then every utterance of her lips for her vows and for binding her soul shall not stand; her husband has annulled them and the L rd will forgive her.
30:14	Every vow and every oath of binding to afflict the soul, her husband shall confirm it and her husband shall annul it.
30:15	And if her husband be silent to her from day to day [i.e., until it gets dark], then he has confirmed all of her vows or all of her bonds which are upon her. He has confirmed them for he was silent to her on the day of his hearing.
30:16	And if he annul them after having heard [and confirmed them (even on the same day)], then he shall bear her sin [i.e., he takes her place (for punishment)].
30:17	These are the statutes which the L rd commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, in her maidenhood (in) the house of her father.
31
31:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
31:2	Take the revenge of the children of Israel from the Midianites [(but not from the Moavites, the latter having been motivated by fear of Israel's plundering them, but the former having entered into a quarrel which was not theirs)]; afterwards you will be gathered unto your people.
31:3	And Moses spoke to the people [(with joy, though his death was attendant upon the defeat of Midian)], saying: Arm from yourselves men [tzaddikim] for the host, and let them be against Midian to execute the vengeance of the L rd against Midian [(opposing Israel being tantamount to opposing the L rd)].
31:4	A thousand to a tribe, a thousand to a tribe, of all the tribes of Israel [including the tribe of Levi] shall you send to the host.
31:5	And there were handed over [(perforce)] of the thousands of Israel, [(the men, knowing that Moses' death was attendant upon the defeat of Midian, refusing to come forward on their own)], a thousand to a tribe, twelve thousand men armed for the host.
31:6	And Moses sent them, a thousand to a tribe, to the host, them and Pinchas the son of Elazar the Cohein to the host, [Pinchas being "equivalent" to all of them, (and Pinchas going rather than Elazar in that he began the mitzvah (of executing vengeance against Midian) by having slain Kazbi, the daughter of Tzur)], and the holy articles [the ark and the tzitz] and the trumpets of teruah in his hand [i.e., with him].
31:7	And they warred against Midian as the L rd had commanded Moses, and they killed every male.
31:8	And the kings of Midian they killed, [causing them to fall] upon their slain: Evi and Rekem, and Tzur, and Chur, and Reva, the five kings of Midian ["of one counsel (against Israel) and of one death"]; and Bilam the son of Beor they slew by the sword [("He exchanged his trade for theirs (desiring to destroy Israel by speech), and they exchanged their trade for his" (killing him by the sword)].
31:9	And the children of Israel took captive the women of Midian; and their little ones and all of their beasts and all of their cattle and all of their goods they took as spoil.
31:10	And all of their cities where they dwelt, and all of their cloisters [the dwellings of their priests] they burned with fire.
31:11	And they took all of the spoil, and all of the booty, of man and of beast.
31:12	And they [took nothing for themselves, but] brought to Moses, and to Elazar the Cohein, and to the congregation of the children of Israel: the captivity [the people], and the booty [the animals], and the spoils [clothing and ornaments], to the camp in the plains of Moav by the Jordan (near) Jericho.
31:13	And Moses and Elazar the Cohein and all the chiefs of the congregation went out to them outside the encampment, [seeing the youth of Israel going out to snatch the spoils].
31:14	And Moses was wroth with the commanders of the host [("The leaders, failing to protest, are accountable for the sins of the generation")], the officers of the thousands, and the officers of the hundreds, who came from the host of battle.
31:15	And Moses said to them: Have you let all the females live!
31:16	These are the women [(They recognized the particular women with whom particular men had sinned)] who were [consigned to harlotry] to the children of Israel by the counsel of Bilam to commit perfidy against the L rd in the affair of Peor, bringing the plague upon the congregation of the L rd.
31:17	And now, kill every male among the little ones; and every woman [capable of] knowing a man for carnal relations, kill.
31:18	And all the little ones among the women who did not know carnal relations, keep alive for yourselves.
31:19	And you, abide outside the camp [the azarah] seven days. Whoever has killed a man [by striking him with a weapon susceptible of uncleanliness] and whoever has touched a slain one shall you cleanse [with the sprinkling waters (of the red heifer)] on the third day and on the seventh day, you and your captives [who become unclean after they are proselytized].
31:20	And every garment, and every vessel of skin, and every work of goats [including vessels made from horns or hooves or bones], and every vessel of wood shall you cleanse.
31:21	And Elazar the Cohein said to the men of the host who came to the war [(Moses, by giving vent to anger (14), having forgotten the halachah)]: This is the statute of the Torah which the L rd commanded Moses, [Elazar attributing the ruling to his teacher].
31:22	But [you may not use vessels, even after they have been cleansed from dead-body uncleanliness, until they are cleansed from carrion absorption] — the gold and the silver, the copper, the iron, the tin and the lead —
31:23	Every thing that comes into the fire [to cook something in it] shall you pass through the fire [to cleanse it from carrion absorption, (vessels being cleansed according to the manner of their use)], and it shall be clean [of carrion uncleanliness]; but with the sprinkling waters shall it be cleansed [of dead-body uncleanliness]. And every thing that does not come into the fire, [such as cups and flasks, which are used for cold things and do not absorb forbidden matter] shall you pass through water [i.e., it is sufficient to immerse them].
31:24	And you shall wash your garments on the seventh day and you shall be clean, and then you shall come to the camp [the camp of the Shechinah (one with dead-body uncleanliness not needing to be sent out of the Levite and Israeli camps)].
31:25	And the L rd said to Moses:
31:26	Count the taking of the captivity in man and beast, you and Elazar the Cohein and the heads of the fathers of the congregation.
31:27	And divide the booty between the warriors who went out to the host and the entire congregation [(half to the first, half to the second)].
31:28	And raise a tribute to the L rd from the men of the war who went out to the host, one soul from the five hundred: from the people, from the herd, from the asses, and from the flock.
31:29	From their half shall you take it, and you shall give it to Elazar the Cohein, the terumah (offering) of the L rd.
31:30	And from the half of the children of Israel shall you take one portion out of fifty: from the people, from the herd, from the asses, from the flock, from all of the beasts; and you shall give them to the Levites, keepers of the charge of the mishkan of the L rd.
31:31	And Moses and Elazar the Cohein did as the L rd had commanded Moses.
31:32	And the booty [of men and animals] was — aside from the spoils [of metaltelin (movable objects)], which the men of the host had taken for themselves — sheep, six hundred and seventy-five thousand.
31:33	And cattle, seventy-two thousand.
31:34	And asses, sixty-one thousand.
31:35	And souls, of the women who had not had carnal relations, all of the souls, thirty-two thousand.
31:36	And the (first) half was, the share of those who went out to the host: the number of sheep, three hundred and thirty-seven thousand and five hundred.
31:37	And the tribute to the L rd from the flock was six hundred and seventy-five.
31:38	And the cattle, thirty-six thousand; and their tribute to the L rd, seventy-two.
31:39	And the asses, thirty thousand and five hundred; and their tribute to the L rd, sixty-one.
31:40	And souls, sixteen thousand; and their tribute to the L rd, thirty-two souls.
31:41	And Moses gave the tribute, the terumah of the L rd, to Elazar the Cohein, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
31:42	And of the half of the children of Israel, which Moses had divided [for the congregation] from the men of the host —
31:43	The half of the congregation from the flock was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand and five hundred.
31:44	And cattle, thirty-six thousand.
31:45	And asses, thirty thousand and five hundred.
31:46	And souls, sixteen thousand.
31:47	— And Moses took from the half of the children of Israel, one portion out of fifty, from the people and from the beasts, and he gave them to the Levites, keepers of the charge of the mishkan of the L rd, as the L rd had commanded Moses.
31:48	And there drew near to Moses those appointed over the thousands of the host, the officers of the thousands and the officers of the hundreds.
31:49	And they said to Moses: Your servants have counted the men of war who were under our charge, and not one of us is missing.
31:50	And we have presented the offering of the L rd, each what he has found: golden vessels, foot bands, arm bands, rings, ear rings, and kumaz [pudendal ornaments (to atone for lustful thoughts towards the daughters of Midian)] to atone for our souls before the L rd.
31:51	And Moses and Elazar the Cohein took the gold from them, all wrought articles.
31:52	And all the gold of the terumah that they devoted to the L rd was sixteen thousand and seven hundred and fifty shekels, from the officers of the thousands and from the officer of the hundreds.
31:53	Each of the men of the host had taken spoils for himself.
31:54	And Moses and Elazar the Cohein took the gold from the officers of the thousands and the hundreds, and they brought it to the tent of meeting, a memorial for the children of Israel before the L rd.
32
32:1	And the sons of Reuven and the sons of Gad had much cattle, a great multitude, and they saw the land of Yazer and the land of Gilead, and behold, it was a place of cattle.
32:2	And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuven came, and they said to Moses and Elazar the Cohein and to the chiefs of the congregation:
32:3	Ataroth and Divon and Yazer and Nimrah and Cheshbon and Elaleh and Sevam and Nevo and Beon [(of the land of Sichon and Og)] —
32:4	The land which the L rd smote before the congregation of Israel — it is a land of cattle, and your servants have cattle.
32:5	And they said: If we have found favor in your eyes, let this land be given to your servants as a holding; do not have us cross the Jordan.
32:6	And Moses said to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuven: Would your brothers go to the war and you remain here!
32:7	And why would you dishearten the children of Israel from crossing into the land which the L rd has given to them, [giving them the impression that you are in awe of the strength of the Canaanites and fear warring with them]?
32:8	Thus did your fathers do when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land.
32:9	And they went up until Nachal Eshkol and they saw the land, and they disheartened the children of Israel, that they not come to the land that the L rd gave to them.
32:10	And the L rd was wroth on that day, and He swore, saying:
32:11	If the men who went up out of Egypt from twenty years and above shall see (i.e., I swear that they shall not see) the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, for they have not fulfilled (My behest by following) after Me.
32:12	Except Calev the son of Yefuneh, the Kenizi [(Calev was the stepson of Kenaz, to whom Calev's mother bore Othniel (see Joshua 15:17)] and Joshua the son of Nun, for they have fulfilled (the L rd's behest by following) after the L rd.
32:13	And the L rd was wroth with Israel, and He made them wander in the desert forty years until the entire generation that did the evil in the eyes of the L rd had been consumed.
32:14	And, behold, you have arisen in your fathers' place, a growth of sinful men, to add even more to the wrath of the L rd against Israel!
32:15	If you turn back from Him, He will place them in the desert yet again, and you will have destroyed all this people!
32:16	And they drew near to him and they said: We will build sheepfolds for our kine here and cities for our little ones [(placing their wealth before their children!)]
32:17	And we will arm ourselves speedily (to go) at the head [of the columns] of the children of Israel [(the men of Gad and Reuven being warriors (see Deuteronomy 33:20, 3:18, and Joshua 6:13)] until we have brought them to their place, and our little ones will abide in the fortified cities against the inhabitants of the land.
32:18	We shall not return to our houses until the children of Israel have inherited, each his inheritance.
32:19	For we will not inherit with them across the Jordan and beyond [on the western side], for our inheritance has come to us [i.e., we have already accepted it] across the Jordan eastwards.
32:20	And Moses said to them: If you do this thing — If you arm yourselves before the L rd for the war,
32:21	And every armed man of you will cross the Jordan before the L rd until He drives out His enemies before Him,
32:22	And the land be conquered before the L rd, and then you return — then you will be clean of (guilt against) the L rd and of (guilt against) Israel, and this land will be a holding unto you before the L rd.
32:33	But if you do not do so, you have sinned against the L rd, and know your sin that shall find you.
32:24	Build for yourselves cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep [(first the cities, then the folds! (see 16)] and what leaves your mouths [to the L rd (that you would remain in the land until they have apportioned it (18)] shall you do [(even though Moses had asked that they remain only until they had conquered it (22)].
32:25	And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuven said to Moses [all as one]: Your servants will do as my lord commands.
32:26	Our little ones, our wives, our kine, and all of our beasts shall be there in the cities of Gilead.
32:27	And your servants shall pass over, every armed man of the host before the L rd to the war, as my lord speaks.
32:28	And Moses appointed over them [(to insure the fulfillment of their conditions)] Elazar the Cohein, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel.
32:29	And Moses said to them: If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuven cross the Jordan with you, each man armed for the war before the L rd, and the land be conquered before you, then you shall give to them the land of the Gilead as a holding.
32:30	And if they do not cross over armed before you, then they shall have a holding in your midst in the land of Canaan.
32:31	And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuven answered, saying: What the L rd spoke to your servants, thus shall we do.
32:32	We shall pass over armed before the L rd into the land of Canaan, and with us [i.e., in our possession and under our jurisdiction] the holding of our inheritance across the Jordan.
32:33	And Moses gave to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuven and to half the tribe of Menasheh the son of Joseph the kingdom of Sichon the king of the Emori and the kingdom of Og the king of the Bashan, the land with the cities in its boundaries, the cities of the land roundabout.
32:34	And the children of Gad built Divon and Ataroth and Aroer.
32:35	And Atroth-Shofan and Yazer and Yagbehah.
32:36	And Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran [(all of these cities to be)] fortified cities and folds for sheep (see 24).
32:37	And the sons of Reuven built Cheshbon and Elalei and Kiryathaim.
32:38	And Nevo and Ba'al Meon [named after Emorite deities], their names being altered, and Sivmah [(the same as Sevam (3)]; and they called by (new) names the names of the cities that they built.
32:39	And the sons of Machir the son of Menasheh went to Gilead and they took it, and they drove out the Emori that were in it.
32:40	And Moses gave the Gilead to Machir the son of Menasheh and he dwelt in it.
32:41	And Yair the son of Menasheh went and he took their villages (chavotheihem) and he called them Chavoth Yair [(as a memorial, having no sons)].
32:42	And Novach went and he took Kenath and its villages, and he called it Novach by his name.

33:1	These are the journeys of the children of Israel, who went out of the land of Egypt by their hosts, by the hand of Moses and Aaron. [These are recorded to apprise us of the L rd's lovingkindness, viz.: Though He decreed that they wander in the desert, they actually made only twenty journeys in thirty-eight years.]
33:2	And Moses wrote down their goings forth according to their journeys by word of the L rd; and these are their journeys by their goings forth.
33:3	And they journeyed from Ra'amses on the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month. On the morrow of the Pesach the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all of Egypt.
33:4	And Egypt was burying [(engrossed in mourning)] those whom the L rd had smitten of them — every first-born. And in their gods the L rd wrought judgment.
33:5	And the children of Israel journeyed from Ra'amses and they encamped in Succoth.
33:6	And they journeyed from Succoth and they encamped in Eitham at the edge of the desert.
33:7	And they journeyed from Eitham and they abode at Pi-Hachiroth, which fronts Ba'al Tzefon; and they encamped before Migdol.
33:8	And they journeyed from Pi-Hachiroth and passed in the midst of the sea to the desert, and they went a distance of three days in the desert of Eitham and they encamped in Marah.
33:9	And they journeyed from Marah and they came to Eilim. And in Eilim there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they encamped there.
33:10	And they journeyed from Eilim and they encamped by the Red Sea.
33:11	And they journeyed from the Red Sea and they encamped in the desert of Sin.
33:12	And they journeyed from the desert of Sin and they encamped in Dafkah.
33:13	And they journeyed from Dafkah and they encamped in Alush.
33:14	And they journeyed from Alush and they encamped in Refidim. And there was no water there for the people to drink.
33:15	And they journeyed from Refidim and they encamped in the desert of Sinai.
33:16	And they journeyed from the desert of Sinai and they encamped in Kivroth Hata'avah.
33:17	And they journeyed from Kivroth Hata'avah and they encamped in Chatzeroth.
33:18	And they journeyed from Chatzeroth and they encamped in Rithmah [so called because of the spies' slander, which is likened (Psalms 20:34) to juniper coals (gachalei rethamim)].
33:19	And they journeyed from Rithmah and they encamped in Rimon Paretz.
33:20	And they journeyed from Rimon Paretz and they encamped in Livnah.
33:21	And they journeyed from Livnah and they encamped in Rissah.
33:22	And they journeyed from Rissah and they encamped in Kehelathah.
33:23	And they journeyed from Kehelathah and they encamped in Har Shafer.
33:24	And they journeyed from Har Shafer and they encamped in Charadah.
33:25	And they journeyed from Charadah and they encamped in Makheloth.
33:26	And they journeyed from Makheloth and they encamped in Tachath.
33:27	And they journeyed from Tachath and they encamped in Tarach.
33:28	And they journeyed from Tarach and they encamped in Mithkah.
33:29	And they journeyed from Mithkah and they encamped in Chashmonah.
33:30	And they journeyed from Chashmonah and they encamped in Moseroth.
33:31	And they journeyed from Moseroth and they encamped in Bnei Ya'akan.
33:32	And they journeyed from Bnei Ya'akan and they encamped in Chor Hagidgad.
33:33	And they journeyed from Chor Hagidgad and they encamped in Yatvathah.
33:34	And they journeyed from Yatvathah and they encamped in Avronah.
33:35	And they journeyed from Avronah and they encamped in Etzyon Gaver.
33:36	And they journeyed from Etzyon Gaver and they encamped in the desert of Sin, which is Kadesh.
33:37	And they journeyed from Kadesh and they encamped in Hor Hahar, at the edge of the land of Edom.
33:38	And Aaron the Cohein went up to Hor Hahar by the "mouth" of the L rd, and he died there [by the Divine kiss] in the fortieth year of the exodus of the children of Israel from the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month.
33:39	And Aaron was one hundred and twenty-three years old when he died in Hor Hahar.
33:40	And the Canaanite heard, the king of Arad [that Aaron had died and the clouds of glory had departed (and he felt that Israel was now vulnerable to attack)]. And he was dwelling in the south, in the land of Canaan, when the children of Israel came.
33:41	And they journeyed from Hor Hahar and they encamped in Tzalmonah.
33:42	And they journeyed from Tzalmonah and they encamped in Punon.
33:43	And they journeyed from Punon and they encamped in Ovoth.
33:44	And they journeyed from Ovoth and they encamped in Iyei ["the wastes"] of Avarim on the boundary of Moav.
33:45	And they journeyed from Iyim and they encamped in Divon Gad.
33:46	And they journeyed from Divon Gad and they encamped in Almon Divlathaymah.
33:47	And they journeyed from Almon Divlathaymah and they encamped in Harei Ha'avarim before Nevo.
33:48	And they journeyed from Harei Ha'avarim and they encamped in the plains of Moav by the Jordan (near) Jericho.
33:49	And they encamped by the Jordan from Beth Hayeshimoth until Aveil [the plain of] Shittim in the plains of Moav [a distance of twelve miles].
33:50	And the L rd spoke to Moses in the plains of Moav by the Jordan (near) Jericho, saying:
33:51	Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: When you are crossing the Jordan [on the dry land] to the land of Canaan, [cross with the following intent (52), that you will drive out the inhabitants of the land, (lacking which, the waters will return and drown you (See Joshua 4:10)].
33:52	And you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you, and you shall destroy all their temples [where they prostrated themselves to idolatry]; and all their molten images shall you destroy, and all of their sacrificial mounds shall you raze.
33:53	And [when] you rid the land [of its inhabitants], you will [be able to] dwell therein; for to you have I given the land to inherit it.
33:54	And you shall possess the land by lot according to your families. For the many shall you increase his inheritance, and for the few shall you decrease his inheritance. Wherever the lot falls for him, it (i.e., that land) shall be his. By the tribes of your fathers [according to the number that left Egypt] shall you inherit.
33:55	And if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land before you, then those you leave over of them shall be as pegs in your eyes and as thorn hedges on your sides ["hedging" you in], and they will vex you on the land in which you dwell.
33:56	And it shall be, as I thought to do to them, I shall do to you.
34
34:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
34:2	Command the children of Israel and say to them: When you come to the land, Canaan, this is the land that shall fall to you [by lot] for an inheritance, the land of Canaan, by its borders: [(Because many mitzvoth obtain in Eretz Yisrael and not outside it, it was necessary to delimit the boundaries exactly.)]
34:3	The south side shall be to you from the desert of Tzin near Edom. And your southern border shall be for you from the eastern edge of the Salt Sea.
34:4	And the border shall incline for you, [bearing northwest] to the south of Ma'aleh Akrabim [(so that Ma'aleh Akrabim is within the boundary)], and it shall pass on to Tzin. And its edge shall be south of Kadesh Barnea. And it shall go out [continuing northwest] to Chatzar Addar, and it shall pass on to Atzmon.
34:5	And the border shall incline from Atzmon to Nachal Mitzrayim [the southwest corner of the boundary], and its [western] edge shall be at the sea.
34:6	And [what is] the western border? The Great Sea and the bounds [i.e., the islands within it)] shall be for you. This shall be the western border for you.
34:7	And this shall be the northern border for you. From the Great Sea you shall turn for yourselves [from west to north] to Hor Hahar [at the northwest corner, sloping into the sea].
34:8	From Hor Hahar you shall turn [and bear east (on the northern border)] to the entrance of Chamath [Antioch]; and the edge of the border [on that particular line, before turning backwards to proceed thence in a wider diagonal] shall be to Tzedad.
34:9	And the (northern) border shall go out to Ziphron and its edge [the end of the northern boundary] shall be at Chatzar Einan. This shall be the northern border for you.
34:10	And you shall turn for yourselves to the eastern border, from Chatzar Einan to Shefam.
34:11	And the border shall descend from Shefam to Rivlah, east of Ayin [(so that Ayin is within the boundary)]. And the border shall go down and hit the shoulder of the Sea of Kinnereth on the east [(so that the Sea of Kinnereth, to the west, is within the boundary)].
34:12	And the border shall descend to the Jordan [(which flows southeastwards towards Canaan, junctures at the Kinnereth, and spills into the Salt Sea)]; and its [southeast] edge shall be the Salt Sea. This shall be for you the land, by its borders roundabout.
34:13	And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying: This is the land which you shall take possession of by lot, which the L rd commanded to give to the nine tribes and the half tribe.
34:14	For the tribe of the sons of the Reuveni by their fathers' house, and the tribe of the sons of the Gadi by their fathers' house, and half the tribe of Menasheh have taken their inheritance.
34:15	The two tribes and the half tribe have taken their inheritance across the Jordan from Jericho, to the fore [of the world], to the east.
34:16	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
34:17	These are the names of the men who shall possess the land for you, [each chief acting as the representative of his tribe and apportioning the tribe's inheritance by families and individuals, selecting a portion appropriate for each]: Elazar the Cohein and Joshua the son of Nun.
34:18	And one chief, one chief, from a tribe shall you take to possess [and take a share in] the land [in your place].
34:19	And these are the names of the men: Of the tribe of Yehudah, Calev ben Yefuneh.
34:20	And of the tribe of the sons of Shimon, Shmuel ben Amihud.
34:21	And of the tribe of Binyamin, Elidad ben Kislon.
34:22	And of the tribe of the sons of Dan, the chief, Bukki ben Yagli.
34:23	Of the sons of Joseph, of the tribe of the sons of Menasheh, the chief, Chaniel ben Efod.
34:24	And of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim, the chief, Kemuel ben Shiftan.
34:25	And of the tribe of the children of Zevulun, the chief, Elitzafan ben Parnach.
34:26	And of the tribe of the sons of Yissachar, the chief, Paltiel ben Azan.
34:27	And of the tribe of the sons of Asher, the chief, Achihud ben Shlomi.
34:28	And of the tribe of the sons of Naftali, the chief, Pedahel ben Amihud.
34:29	These are (those) whom the L rd commanded to effect acquisition [of the land according to its divisions (i.e., families, etc.)] by the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.
35
35:1	And the L rd spoke to Moses in the plains of Moav by the Jordan (near) Jericho, saying:
35:2	Command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites from the inheritance of their holding, cities to dwell in; and an open space for the cities roundabout [(for beauty, not for building or sowing)] shall you give to the Levites.
35:3	And the cities shall be for them to dwell in. And their open spaces shall be for their beasts, for their possessions, and for all of their needs.
35:4	And the open spaces of the cities that you give to the Levites, from the wall of the city and outwards, one thousand cubits roundabout ["two thousand cubits" (5) are to be understood as two thousand cubits all around; the inner thousand for the open space, and the outer, for fields and vineyards.]
35:5	And you shall measure from outside the city: on the east side, two thousand cubits, and on the south side, two thousand cubits, and on the west side, two thousand cubits, and on the north side, two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the midst. This shall be for them the open spaces of the cities.
35:6	And the cities which you shall give to the Levites: the six cities of refuge, which you shall give for the slayer to flee there; and, in addition to them, you shall give forty-two cities.
35:7	All the cities which you shall give to the Levites: forty-eight cities, they and their open places.
35:8	And the cities that you give from the holding of the children of Israel: From the many, shall you give more, and from the few shall you give less. Each, according to his inheritance that they shall inherit shall give of his cities to the Levites.
35:9	And the L rd spoke to Moses, saying:
35:10	Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: When you cross the Jordan to the land of Canaan,
35:11	You shall designate cities for yourselves. Cities of refuge shall there be for you. And there shall flee there a slayer who kills a soul unwittingly.
35:12	And the cities shall be for you as a refuge from the avenger [of the blood, who is kin to the slain man]; and the slayer shall not die until he stand before the congregation for judgment.
35:13	And the cities which you shall provide — six cities of refuge shall there be for you. [(Even though Moses in his lifetime designated three cities across the Jordan as cities of refuge (Deuteronomy 4:41), they did not afford refuge until three had been designated by Joshua in the land of Canaan.)]
35:14	The three cities shall you provide across the Jordan, and the three cities shall you provide in the land of Canaan [(Though there were nine tribes in the land of Canaan, and only two and a half across the Jordan, there were three cities of refuge for both, Gilead (across the Jordan) being "profuse" in slayers)]; cities of refuge shall they be.
35:15	For the children of Israel and for the sojourner and for the dweller in their midst shall these six cities be for refuge, to flee there all who kill a soul unwittingly.
35:16	And if with an iron implement [of any size] he kill him [intentionally], and he die, he is a murderer — die shall die the murderer, [it being known to the L rd that any amount of iron can kill. (Other implements must first be established as lethal before the slayer is put to death, viz. (17 and 18): "whereby he can die.")].
35:17	And if with a hand-stone [i.e., the size of a full hand], whereby he can die [see above], he strike him, and he die, he is a murderer — die shall die the murderer.
35:18	Or if with a wooden implement, whereby he can die, he strike him, and he die, he is a murderer — die shall die the murderer. [(This, to indicate that the "rod" of Exodus 21:20 must be of killing potential.)]
35:19	The avenger, he shall kill the murderer; when he comes upon him, [even within the cities of refuge], he shall kill him.
35:20	And if in hatred he thrust him, or hurl aught at him in ambush, and he die,
35:21	Or if in hatred he strike him with his hand, and he die, then die shall die the smiter; he is a murderer. The avenger shall kill the murderer when he comes upon him.
35:22	And if by accident, without hatred, he thrust him, or he cast upon him some implement, without ambush,
35:23	Or with any stone, whereby one can die he strike him, without seeing [him], and he cast it upon him [with a downward (but not with an upward) movement], and he die, and he not be his foe and not intend his evil,
35:24	Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the avenger according to these judgments,
35:25	And the congregation shall rescue the slayer from the hand of the avenger, and the congregation shall return him to the city of his refuge to which he had fled, and he shall dwell there until the death of the high-priest who had been anointed with the holy oil, [it not being fitting that he, the slayer, whose act leads to the departure of the Shechinah from Israel and the shortening of their lives abide before the high-priest, whose end is the reposing of the Shechinah upon Israel and the lengthening of their lives)].
35:26	And if the murderer go beyond he border of the city of his refuge whither he has fled,
35:27	And the avenger find him outside the border of the city of his refuge, then the avenger may slay the murderer; he has no blood [i.e., he is like one who kills a dead man, who has no blood.]
35:28	For in the city of his refuge shall he dwell until the death of the high-priest; and after the death of the high-priest, the slayer shall return to the land of his holding.
35:29	And these shall be for you a statute of judgment throughout your generations in all of your dwellings [A small sanhedrin obtains outside of Eretz Yisrael so long as one obtains in Eretz Yisrael.]
35:30	Whoever would kill a soul [because he killed another], by the testimony of witnesses [that he killed wittingly and after having been forewarned] shall he kill the slayer; and one witness shall not testify against a soul to have him put to death.
35:31	And you shall not take ransom for the soul of a murderer who is liable to death, but die shall he die.
35:32	And you shall not take ransom for him [who killed unwittingly and] who fled to the city of his refuge, to return to dwell in the land before the death of the (high-) priest.
35:33	And you shall not convict the land in which you are. For the blood convicts the land, and the land will not have atonement for the blood that was spilled in it except by the blood of its spiller.
35:34	And you shall not defile the land which you inhabit, in which I dwell [(so that you not cause Me to dwell in its uncleanliness)], for I, the L rd, dwell in the midst of the children of Israel [even when they are unclean].
36
36:1	And the heads of the fathers of the family of the children of Gilad, the son of Machir the son of Menasheh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, drew near, and they spoke before Moses and before the chiefs of the heads of the fathers of the children of Israel.
36:2	And they said: The L rd commanded my lord to give the land in inheritance by lot to the children of Israel. And my lord was commanded by the L rd to give the inheritance of Tzelafchad our brother to his daughters.
36:3	And if they become wives to any of the sons of the (other) tribes of the children of Israel, then their inheritance will be diminished from the inheritance of our fathers and it will be added onto the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry, [for their sons will inherit them, and the sons are of the father's tribe], and from the lot of our inheritance will it be diminished.
36:4	And [even] when the Jubilee obtains for the children of Israel, [when sold land (as opposed to an inheritance) reverts to its original owner — Even when the Jubilee obtains (the implication being that it is destined to cease for a time)], their inheritance shall be added onto the inheritance of the tribe to which they are wed, and from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers their inheritance will be diminished!
36:5	And Moses commanded the children of Israel by the word of the L rd saying: Rightly does the tribe of the sons of Joseph speak.
36:6	This is the thing that the L rd has commanded respecting the daughters of Tzelafchad, saying: To whom it is pleasing in their eyes shall they be as wives; but to the family of the tribe of their father shall they be as wives.
36:7	And an inheritance of the children of Israel shall not go around from tribe to tribe, but each, to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers, shall the children of Israel cleave.
36:8	And every daughter who receives an inheritance from the tribes of the children of Israel, [(her father having had no son)], to one of the family of the tribe of her father shall she be as a wife, so that the children of Israel will inherit, each, the inheritance of his fathers.
36:9	And an inheritance shall not go around from one tribe to a different tribe, but each to his inheritance shall cleave, the tribes of the children of Israel.
36:10	As the L rd commanded Moses, thus did the daughters of Tzelafchad.
36:11	And Machlah, Tirtzah, Chaglah, Milkah, and Noah, the daughters of Tzelafchad, became wives to the sons of their uncles. [Here they are reckoned in order of their seniority, in which order they wed, whereas elsewhere they are reckoned in order of wisdom (whence it is to be derived that they are to be regarded as equals)].
36:12	(To men) of the families of the sons of Joseph were they wives, so that their inheritance reverted to the tribe of the family of their father.
36:13	These are the mitzvoth and the judgments that the L rd commanded through Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moav by the Jordan (near) Jericho.

1:1	These are the words which Moses spoke [(Because they are words of reproof and he enumerated here all of the places where they angered the L rd, he speaks only by way of allusion out of regard for the honor of Israel)] to all of Israel [(Had he spoken only to some of them, the others might have contended that were they there they could have countered the rebuke)] across the Jordan, concerning [their angering the L rd in] the desert [(viz. Exodus 16:3)], concerning the plain [(their sinning through Ba'al Peor in Shittim, in the plains of Moav)], against Suf [i.e., concerning their rebelling against the L rd at Suf (the Red Sea), (Exodus 14:11)], concerning [what they had done in the desert of] Paran [through the spies], and concerning [their] calumniating [the manna, saying that it was] white [i.e., "flimsy" (see Numbers 21:5)], and [concerning] Chatzeroth [the (encampment of the) Korach insurrection], and [concerning the golden calf that they made because of their] abundance of gold.
1:2	[There is no shorter route from Chorev to Kadesh Barnea than that by way of Mount Seir, it taking] eleven days from Chorev by way of Mount Seir until Kadesh Barnea [and the L rd, in His desire to hasten your entry into Eretz Yisrael, caused you to traverse it in three days; but because of your backsliding He led you around Mount Seir for forty years.]
1:3	And it was, in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that the L rd commanded him concerning them, [Moses reproving them only shortly before his death (taking Jacob as his precedent, who reproved his sons only shortly before his death)],
1:4	[Moses reproving them only] after he had smitten Sichon, king of the Emori, [(reasoning that if he reproved them before entering (at least) part of the land they might regard the reproof as an excuse for his inability to take it)], who dwelt in Cheshbon ["a hard king living in a hard place" — in spite of which Moses defeated him!], and Og, the king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth [lit., "hardness" (again, "a hard king in a hard place")], in Edrei [(the name of the kingdom)].
1:5	Across the Jordan, in the land of Moav, Moses began to explain this Torah [in seventy languages], saying:
1:6	The L rd our G d spoke to us in Chorev, saying: You have dwelt in this mountain long enough.
1:7	Turn and journey [the way to Arad and Charmah] and come to the mountain of the Emori and to all of its neighbors [Ammon, Moav, and Mount Seir], in the plain [the forest plain], in the mountain [the "King's Mountain" (see Gittin 57a)], in the lowland [of the south], in the south and by the seacoast [Ashkelon, Azzah, Caesarea, etc.], the land of the Canaani and the Levanon, until the Great River, the Euphrates [(called the "Great River" because of its being mentioned in conjunction with Eretz Yisrael)].
1:8	See, [with your own eyes], I have set the land before you. Come and possess the land [No one will contest your doing so; you will need no recourse to war (Had they not sent the spies, they would not have needed weapons)], which the L rd swore to your fathers: to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob [(Each was worthy of it in himself)], to give to them and to their seed after them.
1:9	And I said to you at that time, saying [at the behest of the L rd]: I shall not be able to bear you [i.e., to judge you] alone,
1:10	[For] the L rd your G d has elevated you [over your judges (making them accountable for the punishment they impose upon you)], and, behold, you are [like] the day, [i.e., enduring forever like the sun and the constellations], like the stars of the heavens in multitude.
1:11	May the L rd, the G d of your fathers, add to you, such as you, a thousand times! [(At this point, Israel objects: "Would you limit our blessing when the L rd has blessed us boundlessly (Genesis 13:16)!" Moses replies: "That was my blessing")], and let Him bless you [boundlessly] as He spoke to you!
1:12	How can I bear alone [see 9] your contentiousness, your heresy [against your judges], and your caviling!
1:13	Ready yourselves (to appoint) [upright, desirable] men: wise, understanding [one thing from another], and known [i.e., familiar to you] among your tribes, and I shall set them at your heads [to be honored, respected, and feared by you.]
1:14	And you answered me, and you said: Good is the thing that you have spoken to do [(for if we have many judges, we can use a gift to "get on the good side" of those who don't know us!) — this, instead of beseeching me to judge you!]
1:15	And I "took" [with words of suasion] the heads of your tribes, men, wise and known [(but I could not find "understanding" ones)], and I made them heads over you [that you honor them and give them precedence in all matters]: officers of thousands, [one for a thousand], officers of hundreds, [one for a hundred], officers of fifties, and officers of tens, and [I appointed] bailiffs [over you, to enforce the decisions of the judges] for your tribes.
1:16	And I charged your judges [to be deliberate in judgment (regardless of how many times an identical case comes up before them)] at that time, [impressing upon them that they were no longer "free agents," but subservient to the public]: Hear among your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother and his opponent.
1:17	Do not play favorites in judgment [i.e., in appointing judges]. You shall hear [i.e., you shall attach as much importance to] a small [case] as [to] a large one. Do not fear any man, for the judgment is G d's [(You "burden" Him with returning what you take from one unlawfully in judgment.)] And the thing that is too difficult for you, you shall bring near to me and I shall hear it [(— for which "presumptuousness" the judgment in the instance of the daughters of Tzelafchad (Numbers 27:5) evaded Moses)].
1:18	And I charged you at that time with all the things that you shall do [(regarding the ten differences between monetary and capital litigations (see Sanhedrin 32a)].
1:19	And we journeyed from Chorev and we went through all the great and fearful desert [(containing gigantic snakes and scorpions)] that you saw, by way of the mountain of the Emori, as the L rd our G d commanded us, and we came to Kadesh Barnea.
1:20	And I said to you: You have come to the mountain of the Emori, which the L rd our G d gives to us.
1:21	See, the L rd your G d has set the land before you; go up and possess it, as the L rd, the G d of your fathers, has spoken to you. Do not fear and do not be broken.
1:22	And all of you drew near to me ["promiscuously" (as opposed to (5:20): "And you approached me [deferentially], all the heads of your tribes and your elders, etc.")], and you said: Let us send out men before us and let them spy out the land for us. And let them return to us word [concerning the languages that they speak], the [straightest] way by which we should go up, and the cities to which we will come [first, to conquer].
1:23	And the thing was good in my eyes [i.e., I acceded to your request in the hope that my doing so would enhearten you to waive the sending of the spies — but it did not], and I took of you [(from the most select of you)] twelve men, one man to a tribe [(the tribe of Levi not being with them)].
1:24	And they turned and they went up to the mountain, and they came to the river-bed of Eshkol [so called by reason of the cluster (eshkol) of grapes they were to take from there], and they spied it out, [traversing its boundaries, length and width (see Numbers 13:21)].
1:25	And they took in their hand from the fruit of the land and they brought it down to us [(whence it is seen that Eretz Yisrael is higher than all of the other lands)], and they returned word to us, and they [Joshua and Calev] said: Good is the land that the L rd our G d gives us.
1:26	And you did not desire to go up, and you opposed the word of the L rd your G d.
1:27	And you caviled in your tents, and you said: In the L rd's hatred of us [("As you are disposed to another, you think he is disposed to you!")] He took us out of the land of Egypt [(from a fertile land to an arid land)] to deliver us into the hands of the Emori to destroy us.
1:28	Whither are we going up? Our brothers have melted our hearts, saying: A people greater and higher than we; cities great and fortified in heaven [(Scripture speaks hyperbolically here)], and also giants did we see there.
1:29	And I said to them: Do not break and do not fear them.
1:30	The L rd your G d who goes before you — He will war for you, as all that He did with you in Egypt before your eyes.
1:31	And [as all that He did with you] in the desert, where you saw how the L rd your G d bore you, as a man bears his son [(see Exodus 14:19-20)], in all the way that you went until you came to this place.
1:32	And in this thing [that He promises to bring you to the land] you do not believe in the L rd your G d!
1:33	Who goes before you on the way, to seek out for you a place for your encampment — in fire by night to show you the way wherein you should go, and in cloud by day!
1:34	And the L rd heard the voice of your words and He was wroth, and He swore, saying:
1:35	No man of these men, this evil generation, shall see the good land that I swore to give to their forefathers.
1:36	Except Calev the son of Yefuneh — he shall see it, and to him shall I give the land whereon he trod [i.e., Chevron (see Numbers 13:22)], and to his sons, because he filled [his heart to follow] after the L rd.
1:37	Against me, too, was the L rd wroth because of you, saying: You, too, shall not come there.
1:38	Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you — he shall come there; him shall you strengthen, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
1:39	And your little ones, of whom you said that they would fall spoil, and your sons, who do not know this day good and evil — they will come there and to them will I give it, and they will inherit it.
1:40	And you, turn you back, [instead of going directly north through the land of Edom as originally intended] and go through the desert in the direction of the Red Sea, [to the point of the exodus from Egypt, in the southwest corner (for the desert in which they were traveling was south of Mount Seir, between the Red Sea and Mount Seir. Now they were told to go back to the sea and to travel all around the south of Mount Seir from west to east.)]
1:41	And you answered and you said to me: We have sinned to the L rd. We shall go up and do battle according to all that the L rd our G d commanded us, and you girded, each, his weapons of war, and you readied yourselves to go up to the mountain.
1:42	And the L rd said to me: Say to them: Do not go up and do not do battle, for I am not in your midst, and do not be smitten before your foes.
1:43	And I spoke to you, but you did not hearken. And you opposed the word of the L rd, and you ventured, and you went up to the mountain.
1:44	And the Emori went out, who dwelt in that mountain, against you, and they pursued you, as the bees do [(dying when they smote you, just as a bee dies when it stings)], and they smote you from Seir until Charmah.
1:45	And you turned back and you cried before the L rd; but the L rd [Yod-Keh-Vav-Keh, the attribute of mercy] did not heed your voice [(You transformed, as it were, His attribute of mercy to one of cruelty)], and He did not give ear to you.
1:46	And you abode in Kadesh many days (i.e., years), as the days that you abode [in all the other places (Israel wandering aimlessly in the desert for nineteen years before returning to Kadesh)].
2
2:1	And we turned back and we traveled through the desert in the direction of the Red Sea, as the L rd had spoken to me. And we went around Mount Seir [the entire south side until the land of Moav], many days.
2:2	And the L rd said to me:
2:3	You have gone around this mountain long enough — turn to the north [to the east of Moav].
2:4	And the people, charge, saying: You are to pass through the boundary of your brothers, the sons of Esav, who dwell in Seir. They shall fear you; and take great heed:
2:5	Do not incite them: For I shall not allow you [to pass through] their land [without their consent] as much as the space of a footstep, for as an inheritance to Esav have I given the mountain of Seir.
2:6	Food shall you buy of them with money, and you shall eat; and also water shall you buy of them with money, and you shall drink.
2:7	For the L rd your G d has blessed you in all the work of your hand [(Therefore, do not manifest ingratitude for His bounty by showing yourselves poor, but show yourselves rich)]. He knew (i.e., provided for) your going through this vast desert. These forty years the L rd your G d has been with you; you have lacked nothing.
2:8	And we passed from our brothers, the sons of Esav, who dwelt in Seir, by way of the plain, from Eilath and from Etzyon Gaver. And we turned [north] and we passed by the desert of Moav, [proceeding on the eastern side].
2:9	And the L rd said to me: Do not besiege Moav and do not incite a war against them; for I shall not give to you of his land as an inheritance; for to the children of Lot have I given Ar [(the province)] as an inheritance.
2:10	The Eimim [so called because men were in dread (eimah) of them] had dwelt there formerly, a people, great, many, and lofty, like the Anakim, [but this is not the land of Refaim that I promised to Abraham (Genesis 15:20)],
2:11	For they, [the Eimim], too, are reckoned refaim [(giants) so called because the hands of all who see them are "weakened" (mithrapoth)], like the Anakim, [who are called "refaim"]; and the Moavites called them "Eimim." [And I drove out the Eimim-Refaim and placed the children of Lot in their place].
2:12	And, [likewise,] in Seir, the Chorim dwelt formerly, and the sons of Esav would drive them out and destroy them before them, and they dwelt in their place, as Israel did in the land of its inheritance, which the L rd gave to them.
2:13	Now, arise and cross over the stream of Zared. And we crossed over the stream of Zared.
2:14	And the days which we went from Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the stream of Zared were thirty-eight years, until the end of all the generation of the men of war from the midst of the camp, as the L rd swore to them.
2:15	And the hand of the L rd was against them, too, to [hasten to] confound them from the midst of the camp until their end [within the forty years, so that their children be detained no longer in the desert.]
2:16	And it was, when all the men of war [(those from the age of twenty)] had finished dying from amidst the people,
2:17	That the L rd spoke (vayedaber) to me, [the L rd not having spoken to me directly and affectionately (this being the connotation of "vayedaber") all those years from the sending of the spies until now], saying:
2:18	You are passing this day the border of Moav, Ar.
2:19	And you shall draw opposite the children of Ammon [(whence it is seen that Ammon is to the north of Moav)]. Do not besiege them and do not incite them [at all (not only to war, as in the instance of Moav (9), this in reward for the modesty of their progenitor (the younger daughter of Lot, who, (unlike her sister) in naming her child concealed the fact that she had begotten him from her father (see Genesis 19:37-38)]. For I shall not give you of the land of the children of Ammon as an inheritance. For to the children of Lot have I given it as an inheritance.
2:20	That, too, was reckoned a land of refaim, [for] refaim dwelt there formerly (and the Ammonites called them zamzumim) [but this is not the land of the Refaim that I promised to Abraham],
2:21	A people, great, many, and lofty, like the Anakim. And the L rd destroyed them before them (the Ammonites), and they drove them out and dwelt in their place.
2:22	As He did for the sons of Esav, who dwell in Seir, destroying the Chori before them. And they [progressively] drove them out, and they dwell in their place until this day.
2:23	And the Avim [Philistines], who dwelt in Chatzerim as far as Azzah [— Although by Abraham's oath to Avimelech, king of the Philistines, (Genesis 21:24), it would not be permitted to take their land], Kaftorim, who came out of Kaftor destroyed them [the Avim] and dwelt in their place, [so that it is now permitted to take that land.]
2:24	Arise, journey, and cross the stream of Arnon. See, I have given in your hand Sichon, the king of Cheshbon, the Emori, and his land. Begin to drive (him) out, and incite a war against him.
2:25	This day I shall begin to place your awe and your fear upon the face of the peoples under all the heavens, who will hear of your renown, and who will tremble and shudder before you [(whence it is derived that the sun stood still for Moses in this battle and it became known "under all the heavens.")]
2:26	And I sent messengers from the desert of Kedemoth [Sinai] to Sichon, king of Moav, (with) words of peace [(Though I was not commanded to seek peace with Sichon, I learned from the Torah (given at Sinai), which preceded (kadmah) the world (hence "kedemoth") to pursue peace, the Holy One Blessed be He (in pursuit of peace) offering the Torah to all of the other nations, though He knew they would not accept it, before He gave it to Israel)], saying:
2:27	Let me pass through your land. I will go only by the (main) road; I will turn neither right nor left.
2:28	You shall sell me food for money and I shall eat; and water for money shall you give me and I shall drink. Only let me pass through on my feet.
2:29	As there did for me [re food and drink] the sons of Esav, who dwell in Seir, and the Moavites, who dwell in Ar, until I cross the Jordan to the land that the L rd our G d is giving us.
2:30	But Sichon the king of Cheshbon would not allow us to pass through him. For the L rd your G d hardened his spirit and fortified his heart, to deliver him into your hand as of this day.
2:31	And the L rd said to me: See, I have begun to give before you Sichon and his land [(He lowered the tutelary angel of the Emorites beneath Moses' feet and had them tread on his neck)]. Begin to drive (him) out, to inherit his land.
2:32	And Sichon went out against us, [(not sending to Og for assistance, each being "self-sufficient")], he and all his people, to war, to Yahatz.
2:33	And the L rd our G d delivered him before us, and we smote him and his sons [(The written form is "son" — he had a son as mighty as he)], and all his people.
2:34	And we conquered all of his cities at that time. And we laid waste the entire city: men, women, and children; we left no remnant.
2:35	Only the beasts did we take for ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we conquered.
2:36	From Aroer, by the bank of the stream of Arnon and the city by the stream until Gilead. There was no city which was too formidable for us. All, the L rd our G d delivered before us.
2:37	Only to the land of the children of Ammon did you not come near. All [that is] alongside the stream of Yabbok and the cities of the mountain, and all that the L rd our G d commanded [not to conquer, we left alone.]
3
3:1	And we turned and we went up [northwards, in an ascent] by way of the Bashan, and Og the king of Bashan went out against us, he and all of his people, to war in Edrei.
3:2	And the L rd said to me: Do not fear him [(Moses needing this reassurance in view of Og's having abetted Abraham (see Genesis 14:13 and Numbers 21:34)], for in your hand have I given him and all of his people and his land. And you shall do to him as you did to Sichon king of the Emori who dwelt in Cheshbon.
3:3	And the L rd our G d gave into our hands also Og the king of Bashan and all his people. And we smote him until there did not remain of him a remnant.
3:4	And we conquered all of his cities at that time. There was not a city which we did not take from them: sixty cities, the entire province of the palace, [the province being named after the palace], the kingdom of Og in the Bashan.
3:5	All these, cities fortified with a high wall, doors, and bolt, aside from very many unwalled cities.
3:6	And we [progressively] laid them waste, as we did to Sichon king of Cheshbon, laying waste every city: men, women, and children.
3:7	And every beast and the spoil of the cities we scorned [to take] for ourselves, [being already sated with the plunder of Sichon (2:35)].
3:8	And we took at that time the land from the rule of the two kings of the Emori across the Jordan, from the stream of Arnon until Mount Chermon.
3:9	The Tziddonim called Chermon Siryon, and the Emori called it S'nir ["snow" (Chermon had four names, this betokening the excellence of Eretz Yisrael, each of the four kings desiring that it be associated with him)].
3:10	All the cities of the plain and all of the Gilead and all of the Bashan until Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in the Bashan.
3:11	For only Og king of Bashan remained from the rest of the Refaim, [whom Amrafel and his allies killed in Ashteroth Karnayim, Og alone escaping (Genesis 14:5 and 14)]. Behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron. Is it not (to be seen) in Rabbath B'nei Ammon? Nine cubits ("forearms") its length and four cubits its breadth in the cubit of a man [i.e., Og].
3:12	And this land, [from the stream of Arnon until Mount Chermon (8)] we inherited at that time. From Aroer by the stream of Arnon and half the mountain of Gilead and its cities I gave to the Reuveni and the Gadi.
3:13	And the remainder of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half tribe of Menasheh, the entire province of the palace (see 4), with all the Bashan. That is called the land of Refaim [which I promised to Abraham.]
3:14	Yair the son of Menasheh took the entire province of the palace until the boundary of the Geshuri and the Ma'achathi. And he called them by his name — Bashan Chavoth Yair — until this day.
3:15	And to Machir I gave the Gilead.
3:16	And to the Reuveni and the Gadi I gave from the Gilead until the stream of Arnon, the entire stream and more [land beyond the bank], and until the stream of Yabbok, the boundary of the children of Ammon.
3:17	And the plain and the [width of the] Jordan [opposite Gad, who were on the east side of the Jordan] and more [land], from the Kinnereth [on the western side of the Jordan], until the sea of the plain, the Salt Sea, beneath Ashdoth Hapisgah to the east.
3:18	And I charged you [the sons of Reuven and the sons of Gad] at that time, saying: The L rd your G d has given you this land to inherit. Armed shall you pass over before your brothers, the children of Israel, all men of war [They were warriors, who humbled the foe (viz. Numbers 32:17)].
3:19	Only your wives, your little ones, and your cattle — (for) I know that you have much cattle — shall abide in your cities which I gave to you.
3:20	Until the L rd gives repose to your brothers as to you, and they, too, inherit the land which the L rd your G d gives to you across the Jordan; and (then) you shall return, each to his inheritance that I have given you.
3:21	And Joshua I charged at that time, saying: Your eyes that have seen all that the L rd your G d did to these two kings — thus shall the L rd do to all of the kingdoms whither you pass.
3:22	Do not fear them, for the L rd your G d — it is He who wars for you.
Va'ethchanan
3:23	And I entreated (va'ethchanan) the L rd [lit., I asked a "gratuitous" favor of Him. (I did not "pin" it on my desert)], at that time [(after I conquered the land of Sichon and Og, thinking that His vow (that I not enter "the land") might thereby have been annulled (the land of Sichon and Og also being reckoned "the land")], saying:
3:24	O L rd (Yod-Keh-Vav-Keh), G d (Elokim) [Merciful in Judgment], You began to show Your servant Your greatness and Your strong hand [in the war of Sichon and Og]; for who is Almighty in the heavens and in the earth to do as Your deeds and as Your strength? [— therefore, show me the war of the thirty-one kings (of Canaan in the conquest of Eretz Yisrael proper)].
3:25	Let me pass over and see, I pray You, the good land across the Jordan, this good mountain [Jerusalem] and the Levanon [the Temple].
3:26	And the L rd was wroth with me because of you, and He did not heed me. And the L rd said to me: Enough for you! Presume to speak to Me no more about this thing [(so that they not say: "How intransigent the Teacher and how importunate the disciple!")]
3:27	Go up to the top of the height and lift your eyes west and north and south and east; and see with your eyes [(You asked to be shown only the good land (25) — I will show you all of it!)], for you shall not cross this Jordan.
3:28	And charge Joshua [concerning their contentiousness, their heresy, and their caviling (1:12)], and strengthen him and hearten him [with your words, that he not lose heart and say: Just as my master was punished because of them (and could not enter the land), so will it be with me], for [I warrant that] he will pass over before this people and he will cause them to inherit the land that you shall see [(If he passes over before them, they will inherit it; if he does not, they will not.)]
3:29	And we abode in the valley opposite Beth Peor [and you succumbed to idolatry — in spite of which (below): "And now, O Israel, hearken to the statutes, etc." and all will be forgiven you, whereas I did not merit such forgiveness!]
4
4:1	And now, O Israel, hearken to the statutes and to the judgments which I teach you to do, so that you may live and come and inherit the land which the L rd, the G d of your fathers, gives to you.
4:2	You shall not add to the thing that I command you [e.g., placing five sections (instead of four) in the tefillin], and you shall not diminish therefrom, to heed the mitzvoth of the L rd your G d, which I command you.
4:3	(For it is) your (own) eyes that have seen what the L rd did with (the worshippers of) Ba'al Peor. For every man that went after Ba'al Peor — the L rd your G d destroyed him from your midst.
4:4	But you who cleaved to the L rd your G d are all alive this day.
4:5	See, I have taught you statutes and judgments as the L rd my G d commanded me, to do thus in the midst of the land whither you come to inherit it.
4:6	And you shall heed [This is mishnah (learning)], and you shall do [what you have learned]. For this is your wisdom and your understanding [i.e., You will thereby be accounted wise and understanding] in the eyes of the peoples, who will hear of all these statutes and who will say: Surely, a wise and understanding people is this great nation.
4:7	For who is a great nation which has a G d near to it as the L rd our G d in all of our calling to Him?
4:8	And who is a great nation which has righteous statutes and judgments as all of this Torah which I place before you this day?
4:9	Only take heed to yourself, and heed your soul exceedingly, lest you forget the things which your eyes saw, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life. [Only if you do not forget them and do them as prescribed will you be thought wise and understanding; but if you distort them through forgetfulness, you will be accounted foolish.] And you shall impart them to your sons and to the sons of your sons.
4:10	["Lest you forget the things (the sounds and the lightnings) which your eyes saw" on] the day when you stood before the L rd your G d in Chorev, when the L rd said to me: Assemble the people unto Me, and I shall make them hear My words, so that they learn to fear Me all the days that they live on the earth, and so that they teach their children.
4:11	And you drew near and you stood at the foot of the mountain, and the mountain burned in fire until the heart of the heavens: darkness, cloud, and mist.
4:12	And the L rd spoke to you from the midst of the fire. You heard the sounds of words, but you did not see a likeness, only a sound.
4:13	And He told you His covenant, which He commanded you to do, the ten commandments. And He wrote them on two tablets of stone.
4:14	And the L rd commanded me at that time to teach you [the oral law], statutes and judgments, to do them in the land whither you are crossing to inherit it.
4:15	And you shall take great heed to your souls. For you did not see any likeness on the day that the L rd spoke to you in Chorev from the midst of the fire.
4:16	Lest you corrupt yourselves and make for yourselves a graven image of the likeness of any form, the figure of male or female,
4:17	The figure of any beast that is on the earth, the figure of any winged bird which flies in the heaven,
4:18	The figure of any thing that creeps on the ground, the figure of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth.
4:19	And lest you lift your eyes to the heavens [to gaze upon the luminaries and to stray after them], and you see the sun and the moon and the stars — all the host of heaven — and you go astray and bow down to them and serve them, which the L rd your G d allotted to all the peoples under all of the heavens [to provide illumination for them].
4:20	And you did the L rd take, and He brought you forth from the iron crucible, from Egypt, to be to Him a people of inheritance as of this day.
4:21	And the L rd was wroth with me because of your deeds, and He swore that I would not cross the Jordan and that I would not come to the good land that the L rd your G d gives to you as an inheritance.
4:22	For I shall die in this land; I [i.e., even my bones] shall not cross the Jordan. And you shall cross and inherit this good land.
4:23	Take heed unto yourselves lest you forget the covenant of the L rd your G d that He made with you and you make for yourselves a graven image of the likeness of any [thing] that the L rd your G d has commanded you [not to make].
4:24	For the L rd your G d is a consuming fire, a jealous G d ["jealous" in vengeance to exact punishment of idolators].
4:25	When you bear sons and sons of sons and grow old (venoshantem) in the land [(an intimation that they would be exiled at the end of 852 years (this being the gematria of "venoshantem"). But He exiled them two years before, so that they not be subject to "you will go utterly lost" (26)], and you corrupt yourselves and you make a graven image of the likeness of any [thing], and you do what is evil in the eyes of the L rd your G d to anger Him,
4:26	I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day [that I have warned you] that you will go utterly lost, quickly, from the land whither you are crossing the Jordan to inherit it. You will not prolong days upon it, for you will be utterly destroyed.
4:27	And the L rd will scatter you among the peoples, and you will remain few in number among the nations whither the L rd will lead you.
4:28	And you will serve gods there [(By serving their worshippers, it is as if you serve them)], the work of the hands of man, wood and stone, which do not see and do not hear and do not eat and do not smell.
4:29	And you will seek from there the L rd your G d, and you will find Him if you seek Him with all your heart and with all your soul.
4:30	In your affliction, when all these things come upon you, in the end of days, then you shall return to the L rd your G d and you shall hearken to His voice.
4:31	For a G d of mercy is the L rd your G d. He will not let go of you and He will not destroy you, and He will not forget the covenant of your fathers, which He swore to them.
4:32	For ask, now, concerning the first days which were before you, from the day G d created man upon the earth, [and ask also of all the creations] from one end of the heavens to the other end: Has there ever been the like of this great thing or has its like ever been heard?
4:33	[the "great thing":] Has a people ever heard the voice of G d speaking from the midst of the fire as you have and lived?
4:34	Or has a god ever done miracles to come and take for himself a nation from the midst of a nation with [self-imposed] trials, [by which He manifested His strength, e.g., (Exodus 8:5): "Presume to test me, etc." to see whether I can do so], with signs, [confirming Moses as G d's messenger, e.g., (Ibid. 4:2): "What is this in your hand, etc."], and with wonders, [such as the "wondrous" plagues], and with war, [at the Red Sea, viz. (Ibid. 14:25): "For the L rd wars for them"], and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terrors, as all that the L rd your G d did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
4:35	You have been shown to know that the L rd, He is G d; there is none beside Him. [When the Holy One Blessed be He gave the Torah, He opened the seven heavens and the lower regions, and they saw that He was One].
4:36	From the heavens He made you hear His voice to exhort you, and on the earth He showed you His great fire, and His words you heard from the midst of the fire.
4:37	And [all this] because He loved your fathers and He chose their seed after them; and He took you out before Him [as a father leads his son before him (see Exodus 14:19)] with His great strength from Egypt.
4:38	To drive out before you nations greater and mightier than you, to bring you, to give to you their land as an inheritance as [you see] this day.
4:39	And you shall know this day, and you shall set it to your heart, that the L rd, He is G d, in the heavens above and on the earth below; there is none else.
4:40	And you shall keep His statutes and His mitzvoth which I command you this day, which will confer good upon you and your children after you, and so that you prolong days upon the land that the L rd your G d gives you all of the days.
4:41	Then Moses would set apart three cities [i.e., He resolved to set them apart (even though they would not serve as cities of refuge until those in the land of Canaan had been designated, Moses seizing upon the mitzvah that came to hand)], across the Jordan towards the rising of the sun [i.e., on the east of the Jordan].
4:42	To flee there a slayer who slays his neighbor unwittingly, not having hated him heretofore; and he shall flee to one of these cities and he shall live.
4:43	Betzer in the desert in the land of the plain for the Reuveni, Ramoth in Gilead for the Gileadi, and Golan in Bashan for the Menashi.
4:44	And this [(that which follows)] is the Torah which Moses placed before the children of Israel.
4:45	These [which follow] are the [same] testimonies and statutes and judgments which Moses spoke to the children of Israel when they went out of Egypt.
4:46	[He repeated them in the plains of Moav] across the Jordan [on the east], in the valley, opposite Beth Peor, in the land of Sichon king of the Emori, who dwelt in Cheshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote when they went out of Egypt.
4:47	And they inherited his land and the land of Og the king of Bashan, the two kings of the Emori, who were across the Jordan on the east.
4:48	From Aroer, which is by the bank of the stream of Arnon, until Mount Sion, which is Chermon.
4:49	And the entire plain across the Jordan to the east until the sea of the plain beneath Ashdoth Hapisgah.
5
5:1	And Moses called to all of Israel and he said to them: Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the judgments which I speak in your ears this day, and learn and observe them to do them.
5:2	The L rd our G d made a covenant with us in Chorev.
5:3	Not with our fathers [alone] did the L rd make this covenant, but with us — we — these who are here today, all of us living.
5:4	Face to face [and not through an intermediary (whom you might accuse of dissimulation)] did the L rd speak with you in the mountain from the midst of the fire.
5:5	I stood between the L rd and you at that time to relate to you the word of the L rd, for you were awed before the fire and you did not ascend the mountain. [(4): "…did the L rd speak with you"], saying:
5:6	[see Exodus 20:1-14] I am the L rd your G d who took you out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage.
5:7	There shall not be unto you gods of others before My presence [i.e., wherever I am — the entire world].
5:8	You shall not make for yourself a graven image or the likeness of anything which is in the heavens above or in the earth below, or in the waters beneath the earth.
5:9	You shall not bow down to them and you shall not serve them, for I am the L rd your G d, a jealous G d, visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children, and for the third and the fourth generations to those who hate Me,
5:10	And doing lovingkindness for thousands, for My lovers and the keepers of My mitzvoth.
5:11	You shall not take the name of the L rd your G d in vain, for the L rd will not absolve him who takes His name in vain.
5:12	Keep the Sabbath day to set it apart ["Remember" (Exodus 20:8) and "Keep" were stated in one pronouncement, spoken in one word, and heard in one hearing)], as the L rd your G d commanded you [before the giving of the Torah, in Marah].
5:13	Six days shall you work, and you shall do all of your labor.
5:14	And the seventh day is Sabbath to the L rd your G d. You shall not perform any labor: you, and your son, and your daughter, and your man-servant, and your maid-servant, and your ox, and your ass, and all of your beasts, and your sojourner in your gates, so that your man-servant and your maid-servant rest like you.
5:15	And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and that the L rd your G d took you out of there with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm [so that you would be His servants and keep His mitzvoth]; therefore, the L rd your G d commanded you to observe the Sabbath day.
5:16	Honor your father and your mother, as the L rd your G d commanded you [in Marah (see Exodus 15:25)], so that your days be prolonged and so that it be good for you on the land which the L rd your G d gives to you.
5:17	You shall not kill. And you shall not commit adultery. And you shall not steal. And you shall not testify against your neighbor false testimony.
5:18	And you shall not covet your neighbor's wife. And you shall not desire your neighbor's house, his field, and his man-servant, and his maid-servant, his ox, and his ass, and all that belongs to your neighbor.
5:19	These things the L rd spoke to all of your congregation on the mountain from the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness — a great voice, and it did not cease, [His voice being strong and everlasting]. And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and He gave them to me.
5:20	And it was, when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, and the mountain burning in fire, that you drew near to me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders.
5:21	And you said: Behold, the L rd our G d has shown us His glory and His greatness, and we heard His voice from the midst of the fire. This day we saw that G d may speak with a man and he live!
5:22	And now, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us. If we continue hearing the voice of the L rd our G d we shall die.
5:23	For who is there of all flesh who heard the voice of the living G d speaking from the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?
5:24	You draw near and hear all that the L rd our G d says, and you ["at," the feminine form (Moses saying: You rendered me weak (as a woman) by saying this. Were it not better to draw near to Him in love and hear it from Him rather than from me!)], speak to us all that the L rd our G d will speak to you, and we shall hear and we shall do.
5:25	And the L rd heard the voice of your words in speaking to me. And the L rd said to me: I have heard the voice of the words of this people that they spoke to you. They have done well in all that they have spoken.
5:26	Would that this heart of theirs were in them to fear Me and to keep all of My mitzvoth all of the days so that it be good for them and for their children forever!
5:27	Go, say to them: Return you to your tents.
5:28	And you, stand here with Me, and I shall speak to you all the mitzvah and the statutes and the judgments that you shall teach them and that they shall do in the land that I give them to inherit.
5:29	And you shall observe to do as the L rd your G d commanded you; you shall not turn right or left.
5:30	In all the way that the L rd your G d commanded you shall you go, so that you live and it be good for you, and you prolong days in the land that you shall inherit.
6
6:1	And this is the mitzvah, the statutes and the judgments that the L rd your G d commanded to teach you to do in the land whither you are crossing over to inherit it —
6:2	So that you fear the L rd your G d to keep all of His statutes and His mitzvoth that I command you — you, and your son, and your son's son, all the days of your life, and so that your days are prolonged.
6:3	And you shall hear, Israel, and you shall observe to do, so that it be good for you and so that you increase greatly, as the L rd, the G d of your fathers, spoke to you — ("to inherit it":) a land flowing milk and honey.
6:4	Hear, O Israel, the L rd [who is] our G d [now, and not the G d of the peoples — He is destined to be] the one L rd.
6:5	And you shall love the L rd your G d [(Do His mitzvoth out of love)], with all your heart [(with both of your inclinations)] and with all your soul [(even if He takes your soul)] and with all your might [(with all your wealth — this, for one whose wealth is more beloved of him than his soul)].
6:6	["And you shall love, etc." What is this love?] And these things that I command you this day [(They should be like a "new edict" to you)] shall be upon your heart [(for you thereby come to know the Holy One Blessed be He and to cleave to His ways)].
6:7	And you shall teach them (veshinantam) to your sons [lit., "and they (words of Torah) shall be sharp" (in your mouth), so that if one questions you concerning them you will not stammer but answer him forthwith ("sons" here are disciples, and teachers are called "fathers")]. And you shall speak [primarily] in them [words of Torah] in your sitting in your house and in your walking upon the way and in your lying down [i.e., the time of lying down] and in your rising [i.e., the time of rising].
6:8	And you shall bind them as a sign upon your hand [(the arm phylactery)], and they shall be frontlets (totafoth) [denoting "four" (Scriptural sections)] between your eyes [(the head phylactery)].
6:9	And you shall write them on the doorposts (mezuzoth) of your house ["mezuzoth" is written defective (without the vav after the first zayin), indicating that only one mezuzah (per doorpost) is needed], and on your gates [(including the gates of courtyards, provinces, and cities)].
6:10	And it shall be, when the L rd your G d brings you to the land that He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to you, great and good cities that you did not build,
6:11	And houses full of all good that you did not fill, hewn cisterns [(the ground being rocky)], which you did not hew, and vineyards and olive groves, which you did not plant, and you shall eat and be sated —
6:12	Take heed unto yourselves lest you forget the L rd, who took you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
6:13	The L rd your G d shall you fear, and Him shall you serve, and [only then (if you fear and serve Him)] in His name may you swear [(for you will then be circumspect in your oath; but otherwise, do not swear in His name)].
6:14	Do not follow after other gods, of the gods of the peoples that are around you [i.e., Be especially heedful of the latter in that their proximity presents an immediate danger.]
6:15	For a jealous G d is the L rd your G d in your midst. Lest the wrath of the L rd your G d burn against you, and He destroy you from off the face of the ground.
6:16	Do not try the L rd your G d as you tried Him in Massah [when they went out of Egypt and they tried Him with water (Exodus 17:7)].
6:17	Heed diligently the mitzvoth of the L rd your G d, and His testimonies and statutes which He commanded you.
6:18	And you shall do what is just and what is good in the eyes of the L rd [i.e., compromise, beyond the strict letter of the law], so that He do good to you, and you come and inherit the good land that the L rd swore to your forefathers.
6:19	To thrust out all of your foes before you, as the L rd spoke [(Exodus 23:27): "And I shall confound all the people, etc."]
6:20	If your son ask you in time to come, saying: What are the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which the L rd our G d commanded you?
6:21	Then you shall say to your son: We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, and the L rd took us out of Egypt with a strong hand.
6:22	And the L rd wrought signs and wonders, great and sore, against Egypt, against Pharaoh, and against his whole household, before our eyes.
6:23	And he took us thence in order to bring us to give to us the land that He swore to our fathers.
6:24	And the L rd commanded us to do all of these statutes to fear the L rd our G d so that it be good for us all of the days, to keep us in life, as this day.
6:25	And it shall be [accounted] righteousness to us if we observe to do all of this mitzvah before the L rd our G d as He commanded us.
7
7:1	When the L rd your G d brings you to the land whither you come to inherit it, and He casts out many nations before you: the Chitti, the Girgashi, the Emori, the Canaani, the Perizi, the Chivi, and the Yevussi — seven nations more numerous and mightier than you.
7:2	And the L rd your G d delivers them before you and you smite them — lay them waste. You shall not make a covenant with them and you shall not grant them grace [(It is forbidden to say: "How beautiful is this heathen!")].
7:3	And you shall not intermarry with them: Your daughter you shall not give to his son, and his daughter you shall not take for your son.
7:4	For he [your heathen son-in-law] will turn your son [i.e., your grandson] away from Me, [(whence it is seen that your daughter's son by a gentile is called your son (but not your son's son born to a gentile woman, it not being written "For she will turn, etc.")], and they will serve other gods, and the wrath of the L rd will burn in you, and He will destroy you quickly.
7:5	But thus shall you do to them: Their [built-up] altars shall you destroy, and their monuments [of one stone] shall you break, and their asheirah trees, [which they worship] shall you cut down, and their graven images shall you burn with fire.
7:6	For a holy nation are you to the L rd your G d. In you has the L rd your G d chosen to be unto Him a select people of all the peoples on the face of the earth.
7:7	Not because you are more numerous than all the peoples did the L rd desire you and choose you, for you are the smallest of all the peoples.
7:8	But out of the L rd's love for you and in keeping with His oath that He swore to your fathers did the L rd take you out with a strong hand, and He redeemed you from the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
7:9	And you shall know that the L rd your G d is the god, the faithful G d, guarding the covenant and the lovingkindness for His lovers [those who do the mitzvoth out of love], and for the keepers of His mitzvoth [out of fear] for a thousand generations, [(but for "His lovers," for "thousands" (5:10)].
7:10	And He pays His haters to his face [He pays him the recompense for his good, in his lifetime] to make him go lost [from the world to come]. He shall not delay to [pay] His hater; to his face shall He pay him.
7:11	And you shall keep the mitzvah and the statutes and the judgments which I command you today to do them; [and, tomorrow, in the world to come, you will receive their reward.]
Ekev
7:12	And it shall be, if (ekev) you hearken to these judgments, and heed them and do them [i.e., if you observe the relatively slight mitzvoth, which men are wont to tread under their heel (ekev)], then the L rd your G-d will keep for you [His oath re] the covenant and the lovingkindness which He swore to your fathers.
7:13	And He will love you and bless you and multiply you, and He will bless the fruit of your belly and the fruit of your earth: your corn and your wine and your oil, your kine sprung [from the womb] and your choice ones of the flock on the earth which He swore to your fathers to give to you.
7:14	Blessed shall you be of all the peoples. There shall not be among you a barren male or female, or among your beasts.
7:15	And the L rd shall remove from you every ill. And all the sore travails of Egypt which you knew, He shall not place in you, but He shall place them in all of your haters.
7:16	And you shall devour all the peoples that the L rd your G d delivers unto you. Let your eye have no mercy upon them and do not serve their gods; for it is a snare unto you.
7:17	Lest you say in your heart: (Many) more are these nations than I — How will I be able to drive them out!
7:18	— You shall not fear them. Remember well what the L rd your G d did to Pharaoh and to all of Egypt.
7:19	The great trials that your eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders (see 4:34), and the strong hand [the (plague of) pestilence], and the outstretched arm [the "sword" of the plague of the first-born] wherewith the L rd your G d took you out. Thus shall the L rd your G d do to all of the peoples whom you fear.
7:20	And also the tzirah [a kind of flying insect, which poisoned them, and castrated them, and blinded their eyes wherever they were hiding] will the L rd your G d send against them, until there shall perish the remnant and the hidden from before you.
7:21	Do not break before them, for the L rd your G d is in your midst, a great and awesome G d.
7:22	And the L rd your G d will cast out these nations before you little by little. You will not be able to consume them quickly, lest there increase against you the animals of the field.
7:23	And the L rd your G d shall deliver them before you. And He shall confound them with a great confusion until they are destroyed.
7:24	And He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall cause their name to go lost from under the heavens. A man will not stand up against you until you have destroyed them.
7:25	The graven images of their gods shall you burn in fire. You shall not covet the silver and the gold upon them and take it to you lest you be ensnared by it. For it is the abomination of the L rd your G d.
7:26	And you shall not bring an abomination into your house, lest you be rejected as it is. Despise shall you despise it and abominate shall you abominate it; for it is rejected.
8
8:1	Every mitzvah which I command to you this day shall you observe to do, that you may live and multiply, and come and inherit the land that the L rd your G d swore to your fathers.
8:2	And you shall remember all the way in which the L rd your G d led you this forty years in the desert, to afflict you to test you to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His mitzvoth [without trying Him or "bethinking yourself" of Him], or not.
8:3	And He afflicted you, and He made you hunger, and He fed you the manna, which you did not know, and which your fathers did not know, to make it known to you that not through bread alone shall a man live, but by all that issues from the mouth of the L rd shall a man live.
8:4	Your raiment did not wear out from upon you [The clouds of glory would rub their clothing clean, and the garments of children would grow to match their growth], and your feet did not swell [like dough (as occurs with those who go barefoot)] this forty years.
8:5	And you shall know within your heart that as a man afflicts his son, so does the L rd your G d afflict you.
8:6	And you shall keep the mitzvoth of the L rd your G d, to walk in His ways and fear Him.
8:7	For the L rd your G d is bringing you to a good land, a land of streams of water, fountains and depths, issuing forth in valleys and in mountains.
8:8	A land of wheat, barley, grapevine, fig, and pomegranate; a land of olive-oil and honey.
8:9	A land where not in constraint shall you eat bread. You shall lack nothing in it; a land whose stones are iron and from whose mountains you shall hew copper.
8:10	And you shall eat, and you shall be sated, and you shall bless the L rd your G d for the good land that He has given you.
8:11	Take heed unto yourself lest you forget the L rd your G d, not to keep His mitzvoth and His judgments and His statutes that I command you this day.
8:12	Lest you eat and be sated, and you build and inhabit good houses,
8:13	And your herds and your flocks increase, and silver and gold increase for you, and whatever you have increase,
8:14	And your heart be lifted and you forget the L rd your G d who took you out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage,
8:15	Who led you in the great, awesome desert of snake, serpent, scorpion and waterless drought, who brought forth water for you from the rock of flint,
8:16	Who fed you manna in the desert, which your fathers did not know, in order to afflict you and in order to try you, to benefit you in your latter end,
8:17	And you say in your heart: My strength and the might of my hand have wrought this wealth for me —
8:18	Then you shall remember the L rd your G d. For it is He who gives you strength to prosper, to establish His covenant that He swore to your fathers, as of this day.
8:19	And it shall be, if you forget the L rd your G d and walk after other gods and serve them and bow down to them, I testify against you this day that you shall surely go lost.
8:20	As the nations which the L rd causes to go lost from before you, so will you go lost, for you did not hearken to the voice of the L rd your G d.
9
9:1	Hear, O Israel, you are crossing over the Jordan today to come to inherit nations who are greater and mightier than you [(You are mighty, but they are mightier than you)], great cities, and fortified in the heavens.
9:2	A people great and lofty, the sons of Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard (saying): Who can stand up against the sons of Anak!
9:3	And you shall know this day that the L rd your G d — He crosses over before you, a consuming fire. He shall destroy them and He shall humble them before you. And you shall drive them out, and you shall cause them to go lost quickly, as the L rd has spoken to you.
9:4	Do not say in your heart, when the L rd your G d thrusts them from before you: In my righteousness did the L rd bring me to inherit this land, and that because of the wickedness of these nations [together with your righteousness] the L rd drives them out before you.
9:5	Not in your righteousness and in the uprightness of your heart do you come to inherit their land, but in the wickedness of these nations does the L rd your G d drive them out before you, and to establish the thing that the L rd swore to your fathers: to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
9:6	And you shall know that it is not in your righteousness that the L rd your G d gives you this good land to inherit it, for you are a stiff-necked people.
9:7	Remember, do not forget, your having angered the L rd your G d in the desert. From the day you left the land of Egypt until your coming to this place, you have been rebellious against the L rd.
9:8	And in Chorev you angered the L rd, and the L rd was wroth with you to destroy you.
9:9	When I went up to the mountain to take the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the L rd made with you. And I was kept in the mountain forty days and forty nights. Bread I did not eat, and water I did not drink.
9:10	And the L rd gave me the two tablets of stone, [(both were alike)], written with the finger of G d; and on them as all the things that the L rd spoke with you in the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly.
9:11	And it was at the end of forty days and forty nights that the L rd gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant.
9:12	And the L rd said to me: Arise, descend quickly hence. For the people that you took out of Egypt have corrupted themselves. They have turned quickly from the way that I commanded them; they have made a molten image.
9:13	And the L rd said to me: I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff-necked people.
9:14	Quit Me and I shall destroy them, and I shall erase their name from beneath the heavens, and I shall make you a nation mightier and more numerous than they.
9:15	And I turned, and I went down from the mountain. And the mountain burned in fire, and the two tablets of stone on my two hands.
9:16	And I saw, and, behold, you had sinned against the L rd your G d; you had made for yourselves a molten calf. You had turned quickly from the way that the L rd had commanded you.
9:17	And I took hold of the two tablets and I cast them from my two hands, and I broke them before your eyes.
9:18	And I prostrated myself before the L rd as at first (see Exodus 33:30), forty days and forty nights. Bread I did not eat, and water I did not drink, because of all your sins wherein you had sinned, to do the evil in the eyes of the L rd to anger Him.
9:19	For I was affrighted before the anger and the wrath wherein the L rd was wroth against you to destroy you. And the L rd hearkened to me at that time too.
9:20	And against Aaron was the L rd extremely wroth, [(for having heeded them)], to destroy him [(This connotes the killing of his children)], and I prayed also on Aaron's behalf at that time [(and my prayer availed to atone for half, two of his sons remaining alive)].
9:21	And your sin that you wrought — the calf — I took it and I burnt it in fire, and I crushed it, grinding it down, until it was thin as dust. And I cast its dust into the stream that ran down from the mountain.
9:22	And in Taveirah and in Massah and in Kivroth Hata'avah you roused the ire of the L rd.
9:23	And when the L rd sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying: Go up and possess the land that I have given you, you rebelled against the word of the L rd your G d, and you did not believe Him, and you did not hearken to His voice.
9:24	You were rebellious against the L rd from the day I knew you!
9:25	And I prostrated myself before the L rd the forty days and the forty nights that I did, for the L rd had spoken to destroy you.
9:26	And I prayed to the L rd and I said: O L rd G d, do not destroy Your people and Your inheritance that You redeemed in Your greatness, that You took out of Egypt with a strong hand.
9:27	Remember Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not turn to the hardness of this people, and to its wickedness, and to its sin.
9:28	Lest they [the people of] the land whence you brought us forth say: Because the L rd was not able to bring them to the land whereof He spoke to them, and in His hatred of them, He took them out to put them to death in the desert —
9:29	And they are Your people and Your inheritance, whom You took out in Your great strength and with Your outstretched arm.
10
10:1	At that time [(at the end of forty days)] the L rd said to me: Hew for yourself two tablets of stone like the first and ascend to Me to the mountain and make for yourself an ark of wood [(This was not the ark which Bezalel made, but a different one, which went out with them to war.)]
10:2	And I shall write upon the tablets the words which were on the first tablets, which you broke, and you shall place them in the ark.
10:3	And I made an ark of acacia wood [(before hewing the tablets so that it would be ready to receive them)], and I hewed two tablets of stone like the first, and I ascended the mountain with the two tablets in my hand.
10:4	And He wrote on the tablets like the first writing, the ten commandments which the L rd spoke to you from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly, and the L rd gave them to me.
10:5	And I turned and I descended the mountain, and I placed the tablets in the ark that I had made, and they were (contained) there, as the L rd had commanded me.
10:6	And the children of Israel journeyed from Be'eroth B'nai Ya'akan to Moserah. [This, too, is part of the reproof, viz.: This, too, did you do. When Aaron died in Hor Hahar at the end of forty days and the clouds of glory departed, you feared war with the king of Arad and you turned to go back to Egypt. You retraced eight journeys until B'nai Ya'akan, and thence to Moserah, where the sons of Levi warred with you (many being killed on both sides), until they forced you to retrace your retreat.] There [in Moserah] Aaron died [i.e., You made great mourning over Aaron, whose death had led to all this, so that it seemed to you as if he had died there,] and he was buried there [see Numbers 21:4]. And Elazar his son was Cohein in his place. [(This reproof is juxtaposed with that of the breaking of the tablets by way of showing that the death of the righteous is as grievous to the Holy One Blessed be He as the day of the breaking of the tablets, and that their saying "Let us make a head, etc." to abandon Him (see Numbers 14:4) is as grievous as the day on which they made the golden calf.)]
10:7	From there they journeyed [i.e., they returned] to Gudgodah [the same as Chor Hagidgad (Numbers 33:32)], and from Gudgodah to Yatvathah, a land of streams of water.
10:8	At that time [(a reversion to the beginning, i.e., In the first year of the exodus from Egypt, when you sinned with the golden calf, and the tribe of Levi did not sin)], the L rd set apart the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of the covenant of the L rd [(This is juxtaposed with the retreat to B'nai Ya'akan to show that there, too, the tribe of Levi did not waver but were staunch in their faith)], to stand before the L rd [(This refers to the Cohanim)] to minister unto Him and to bless His name [(the priestly blessing)] until this day.
10:9	Therefore, [because they were set apart for the service of the altar and are not free to plow and to sow], Levi did not have a portion and an inheritance with his brothers; the L rd is his inheritance [i.e., he has a "steady stipend" from the king's house], as the L rd your G d spoke to him.
10:10	And I stood on the mountain [to receive the second tablets] as (I did) the first days, [those of receiving the first tablets], forty days and forty nights [(Just as they were days of favor, so were these; but the intervening ones, when I stood there to pray on your behalf, were days of anger.)] And the L rd hearkened unto me at that time, too: the L rd did not want to destroy you.
10:11	And the L rd said to me: Arise, go to journey before the people [(Though you had turned away from Him and made the golden calf, He said to me (Exodus 32:34): "Go, lead the people, etc.")], so that they come and inherit the land that I swore to their fathers to give to them.
10:12	And now, O Israel, [even though you have done all this, His compassion and love are still with you; and — with all of your sins against Him —] what does the L rd your G d ask of you but to fear the L rd your G d, to walk in all of His ways, to love Him, and to serve the L rd your G d with all of your heart and with all of your soul,
10:13	To keep the mitzvoth of the L rd and His statutes that I command you this day [— and even that, not without recompense, but] for your good [i.e., to receive reward].
10:14	Behold, to the L rd your G d are the heavens and the heavens of the heavens, the earth and all that is in it, [in spite of which, of all the creations],
10:15	Only your fathers did the L rd desire to love them; and He chose their seed after them — you, [as you see yourselves desired of all peoples], as of this day.
10:16	And you shall circumcise the foreskin [i.e., the closure] of your hearts, and your necks shall you stiffen no more.
10:17	For the L rd your G d — He is the G d of gods and the L rd of lords [No lord can rescue you from His hand], the great, mighty, awesome G d, who will not forgive [if you cast off His yoke] and who will not take graft [i.e., He cannot be conciliated with money].
10:18	He does the judgment of orphan and widow ["Where you find His might, you find His humility"], and He loves the stranger, to give him bread and clothing, [the very essence of Jacob's supplication to the L rd (Genesis 28:20)].
10:19	And you shall love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt [Do not ascribe your own blemish to others.]
10:20	The L rd your G d shall you fear, Him shall you serve, and to Him shall you cleave, and [only then,] in His name may you swear [see 6:13].
10:21	He is your glory and He is your G d, who did with you these great and awesome things which your eyes have seen.
10:22	With seventy souls did your fathers go down to Egypt, and now, the L rd your G d has made you as the stars of heaven in multitude.
11
11:1	And you shall love the L rd your G d, and you shall keep His keeping and His statutes and His judgments and His mitzvoth all of the days.
11:2	And you shall know this day [Give heart to know and to understand and to accept my reproof], for it is not [with] your children [that I speak now], who did not know and who did not see the chastisement of the L rd your G d, His greatness, His strong hand, and His outstretched arm,
11:3	And His signs and His deeds which He wrought in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to all his land,
11:4	And what He wrought to the host of Egypt, to his horses and to his chariots, flooding the waters of the Red Sea over their faces when they pursued you (and the L rd caused them to go lost until this day),
11:5	And what He wrought for you in the desert until you came to this place,
11:6	And what He wrought against Dathan and Aviram the sons of Eliav the son of Reuven, the earth opening its mouth and swallowing them and their houses, and their tents, and all of the wealth at their feet in the midst of all of Israel [Wherever one of them would flee, the earth would split beneath him and swallow him] —
11:7	("It is not with your children, who did not know, etc." (2), with whom I speak now,) but [with you,] whose eyes have seen the entire great deed of the L rd, that He has wrought.
11:8	And you shall keep the entire mitzvah that I command you this day, so that you be strengthened and come and inherit the land whither you are crossing to inherit it.
11:9	And so that you prolong days on the land that the L rd swore to your fathers to give to them and to their seed, a land flowing milk and honey.
11:10	For [(as they were assured when they left Egypt)] the land whither you are coming to inherit it is not like the land of Egypt [Ramses, the very best of the land of Egypt], from which you went forth, [but it is superior even to Ramses], where you sowed your seed and watered it with your foot [i.e., You had to go by foot to bring water from the Nile to water your land], as [it is necessary to do with] a garden of herbs, [rain alone not sufficing for it],
11:11	But the land whither you are crossing to inherit it is a land of mountains and plains, [(yet you may sleep soundly there. For unlike Egypt, where you had to carry water from the low places to the high, in Eretz Yisrael the Holy One Blessed be He waters everything, high and low, seen and unseen, alike)] — From the rain of the heavens you will drink water.
11:12	A land which the L rd your G d inquires after, [(the allotment for other lands depending upon this "inquiry")]. Always, the eyes of the L rd your G d are in it [for the ascertainment of its needs and for the making of decrees (sometimes for the good, sometimes otherwise)], from the beginning of the year until the end of the year. [On Rosh Hashanah the land is judged for what is to transpire in it until the end of the year.]
11:13	And it shall be [i.e., "From the rain of the heavens you will drink water" (11)] if you hearken, hearken [(i.e., If you hearken to the old, you will "hear" the new)] to My mitzvoth which I command you this day [(They should be "new" to you, as if you had heard them "this day")], to love the L rd your G d [(Do not study in order to be rich or honored or rewarded; but do all out of love, and the rest is bound to come)], and to serve Him with all your [(plural)] heart ["service of the heart," i.e., prayer], and with all your [(plural)] soul [(an exhortation to the community; verse 6:5 is an exhortation to the individual)],
11:14	Then I shall give the rain of your land [(You, doing what is yours, I shall do what is Mine)] in its (proper) time [(at night, so as not to incommode you)], the yoreh, [the rain which falls after sowing, which "saturates" (marveh) the ground], and the malkosh, [the "latter" rain, which falls before the harvest to ripen the grain], and you [and not your foes] will gather in your corn, and your wine and your oil.
11:15	And I shall give grass in your field to your beasts [(You will not need to lead them to other fields)]; and you will eat and you will be sated [(Your bread will be "blessed" in your stomach.)]
11:16	Take heed unto yourselves lest [eating and being sated] your hearts be enticed, [one rebelling against the L rd only out of satiety (see 8:12-14)], and you go astray, [separating yourselves from the Torah], and [as a result] you [come to] serve other gods, ["others," i.e., "strangers," to those who serve them — being cried out to and not answering], and you bow down to them.
11:17	And the wrath of the L rd will burn against you, and He will hold back the heavens and there will not be rain, and the ground will not yield [even] yevulah [what you bring (movil) to it], and [in addition to all of the other afflictions], you will go lost quickly [into exile] from the good land that the L rd gives you, [the fatness of the land having caused you to sin. ("quickly"): unlike the generation of the flood, which was given a grace period; for you had from whom to learn, whereas they did not.]
11:18	And you shall place these, My words, upon your heart and upon your souls [(Even after you are exiled, be distinctive with mitzvoth: Put on tefillin, affix mezuzoth, so that they not be new to you when you return)]. And you shall bind them as a sign upon your hand and they shall be frontlets between your eyes.
11:19	And you shall teach them to your sons to speak through them [(As soon as your son is ready to speak, teach him (33:4): "Torah did Moses command us" to initiate him into speaking)], in your sitting in your house, and in your walking upon the way, and in your lying down, and in your arising.
11:20	And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and upon your gates.
11:21	So that your days be prolonged and the days of your children [(But if not, they will not be prolonged)], on the land that the L rd swore to your fathers to give to them [(a Scriptural allusion to the resurrection)], as the days of heaven upon the earth.
11:22	For if you keep, keep, all of this mitzvah that I command you to do [(an exhortation to many "keepings," that one take care not to forget his learning)], to love the L rd your G d, to walk in all His ways [i.e., As He is merciful, so you be merciful, etc.], and to cleave to Him [(Cleaving to Torah scholars is accounted cleaving to the L rd)],
11:23	Then the L rd will drive out all these nations from before you [(You, doing what is yours, I shall do what is Mine)], and you will inherit nations greater and mightier than you [(You are mighty, but they are mightier than you)].
11:24	Every place where the soles of your feet tread shall be yours. From the desert and the Levanon, from the river, the river Perath, until the western sea shall be your border.
11:25	No man [— even one like Og, the king of Bashan —] will stand up against you. Fear of you [(on the part of those near you)] and dread of you [(on the part of those distant)] shall the L rd G d place on the face of all the land where you will tread, as He spoke to you [viz. Exodus 23:27].
Re'eh
11:26	Behold, I set before you this day blessing and curse, [those (to be) pronounced in Mount Gerizim and Mount Eival].
11:27	The blessing, so that you hearken to the mitzvoth of the L rd your G d, which I command you this day.
11:28	And the curse, if you do not hearken to the mitzvoth of the L rd your G d and you turn away from the way that I command you this day, to go after other gods, which you did not know, [whence it is derived that serving idolatry is tantamount to denying the entire Torah ("the way")].
11:29	And it shall be, when the L rd your G d brings you to the land whither you come to inherit it, that you shall set the blessers towards Mount Gerizim and the cursers towards Mount Eival. [The blessers face Mount Gerizim and recite: "Blessed is the man who does not make a graven or a molten image," and then they turn to Mount Eival and recite the corresponding curse, viz. (27:15): "Cursed is the man who makes a graven or a molten image," etc.]
11:30	Are they [the mountains] not beyond the passage of the Jordan towards the setting of the sun [the west], in the land of the Canaani, who dwells in the plain, distant from Gilgal, near Eilonei Moreh [Shchem]?
11:31	When you cross the Jordan to come to inherit the land that the L rd your G d gives to you, [the miracles that you experience then will be a sign to you that] you will inherit it and you will dwell in it.
11:32	And you shall observe to do all of the statutes and the judgments that I set before you this day.
12
12:1	These are the statutes and the judgments which you shall observe to do in the land which the L rd, the G d of your fathers, gave to you to inherit, all the days that you live upon the earth.
12:2	Destroy shall you destroy [(whence it is derived that in destroying idolatry one must uproot it entirely)], from all of the places where the nations which you are inheriting worshipped, their gods [which are] on the high mountains and on the hills and under every leafy tree.
12:3	And you shall raze their altars [of many stones] and you shall break their monuments [of one stone], and their asheiroth [trees that they worship] shall you burn in fire, and the graven images of their gods shall you cut down, and you shall cause their name to go lost from that place [by giving it a new, demeaning name].
12:4	You shall not do thus [to offer sacrifices in all places] to the L rd your G d.
12:5	But to the place that the L rd your G d will choose from all your tribes to place His name there; His dwelling [the sanctuary of Shiloh] shall you inquire after, and you shall come there.
12:6	And you shall bring there your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices [obligatory peace-offerings] and your tithes [the beast-tithe and ma'aser sheni], and the offering of your hands [first-fruits], and your vows and your gifts, and the firstborn of your herds and your flocks [to give them to the Cohein to be sacrificed there].
12:7	And you shall eat there before the L rd your G d, and you shall rejoice in all to which you put your hand; you and your households. [Bring offerings in accordance with the blessing] wherewith the L rd your G d has blessed you.
12:8	[(11:31): "When you cross the Jordan, etc." and you are permitted to sacrifice on bamoth (temporary altars) all the fourteen years of conquest and apportionment of the land], you shall not do [i.e., you shall not sacrifice upon the bamoth] according to all that we do here today [in the tabernacle (mishkan) that is with you and which is anointed and fit for sin-offerings, guilt-offerings, and vow and gift-offerings, but] a man [may offer on the bamoth, only] all that is fitting in his eyes [i.e., vow and gift-offerings].
12:9	For you will not yet have come [all those fourteen years] to the rest [Shiloh] and to the inheritance [Jerusalem] that the L rd your G d gives you.
12:10	And you will cross the Jordan, and you will dwell in the land that the L rd your G d causes you to inherit. [After you apportion it and each one knows his portion and (that of) his tribe], and He gives you rest from all of your foes roundabout [which He left there to test you], and you dwell secure [(This did not transpire until the days of David)] —
12:11	[Only then] the place the L rd your G d shall choose to repose His name therein — [(build the Temple in Jerusalem. All of this occurred as stated (see II Samuel 7:1-1)] — there [in Jerusalem (After the destruction of Shiloh, bamoth were permitted at intervals until they came to Jerusalem)] shall you bring all that I command you: your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes and the offering of your hands, and all your choice vows [(One should bring only of the choicest)] that you vow to the L rd.
12:12	And you shall rejoice before the L rd your G d: you, your sons, your daughters, your men-servants, your maid-servants, and the Levite in your gates; for he has no portion or inheritance with you.
12:13	Take heed unto yourselves [A negative commandment is superadded to the positive (11)] lest you offer up your burnt-offerings in every place that you see [fit (but you may do so at the behest of a prophet, viz. Eliyahu on Mount Carmel)].
12:14	But only in the place that the L rd shall choose, in (the portion of) one of your tribes [Benjamin] — there shall you offer up your burnt-offerings, and there shall you do all that I command you.
12:15	Only [(This excludes from redemption consecrated animals with passing blemishes)], with all the desire of your soul may you slaughter [after redemption, consecrated animals which have sustained a (permanent) blemish], and you may eat [in any place] flesh, [(but you may not use their fleece and their milk)], according to the blessing of the L rd your G d that He has given you in all of your gates. The unclean one and the clean one may eat of it [from the same plate (even though it was once consecrated)], as the deer and as the hart [from which a sacrifice is never brought; and, like them, too, in that they are exempt from the priestly gift (shoulder, cheeks, and maw)].
12:16	Only the blood shall you not eat, [even though it is not to be sprinkled on the altar]; on the earth shall you spill it as water [It does not require covering].
12:17	You shall not be able to eat in your gates [A negative commandment is superadded to the positive (11)] the tithe of your corn and your wine and your oil and the first-born of your herd or your flocks [(this, being an exhortation to the Cohanim)], and all your vows which you vow, and your gifts, and the offering of your hands [bikkurim].
12:18	But only before the L rd your G d [within the wall] shall you eat it, in the place that the L rd your G d chooses — you, your son, your daughter, your man-servant, your maid-servant, and the Levite who is in your gates [(If you cannot give him of his portion, the first tithe, give him second tithe; if you have no second tithe, invite him to partake with you of your peace-offerings)], and you shall rejoice before the L rd your G d in all to which you put your hand.
12:19	Take heed unto yourself lest you forsake the Levite all of your days upon your land [(But in the exile, you are not exhorted more towards him than towards any of the poor of Israel.)]
12:20	When the L rd your G d broadens your boundary as He spoke to you, and you say I shall eat flesh, for your soul shall desire to eat flesh [(The Torah hereby teaches proper conduct, that one should desire to eat flesh only out of "expansiveness" and wealth)], then with all the desire of your soul shall you eat flesh [(But in the desert, mundane (non-consecrated) flesh (chullin) was not permitted to them until the animal was consecrated and sacrificed as peace-offerings)].
12:21	If the place be distant from you in which the L rd your G d shall choose to place His name, [and you will not be able to come and bring peace-offerings every day, as you can now that the mishkan travels with you], then you shall slaughter of your herd and of your flock that the L rd has given you, as He commanded you [(whence it is seen that there is a command as to the proper procedure for slaughtering, these being the laws of shechitah as stated to Moses on Sinai)], and you shall eat in your gates with all the desire of your soul.
12:22	Only [(This excludes permission to eat fats of a beast of chullin, though it is permitted to eat those of an animal, viz., deer and hart.)] as the deer and hart are eaten [i.e., even in a state of uncleanliness], so shall you eat it; the unclean one and the clean one together may eat it.
12:23	Only strengthen yourself not to eat the blood [(whence it is seen that they were drawn to the eating of blood)]. For the blood is the life, and you shall not eat the life with the flesh [(an exhortation against (eating) ever min hechai (a limb torn from a living animal)].
12:24	You shall not eat it [an exhortation against (eating) dam hatamtzith (the residue of the blood flow)]; on the earth shall you spill it as water.
12:25	You shall not eat it [an exhortation against (eating) the blood of the organs], so that it be good for you and your children after you for doing what is just in the eyes of the L rd.
12:26	Only your consecrated things which shall be to you, and your vows, shall you bear and you shall come to the place that the L rd shall choose. [i.e., Though you are permitted to slaughter chullin, I did not permit you to slaughter consecrated animals and to eat them in your gates without offering them up; but bring them to the Temple.]
12:27	And you shall offer your burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of the L rd your G d [i.e., If they are burnt-offerings, place the flesh and the blood on the altar], and [if they are peace-offerings] the blood of your sacrifices shall be spilled on the altar of the L rd your G d [first], and [then] the flesh shall you eat.
12:28	Keep [mishnah (i.e., learning) within you] so that you will heed all of these things that I command you, [i.e., so that a "light" mitzvah be as beloved by you as a "weighty" one], so that it be good for you and for your children after you forever for doing what is good [in the eyes of Heaven] and just [in the eyes of man] in the eyes of the L rd your G d.
12:29	When the L rd your G d will cut off the nations whither you come to inherit them, from before you, and you inherit them and dwell in their land,
12:30	Take heed unto yourselves lest you are drawn in after them after [i.e., in spite of having witnessed] their destruction before you [for their perverse deeds], and lest you inquire after their gods, saying: How did these nations serve their gods that I may do the same? [(We are hereby apprised that if the service of a particular god is not a conventional one, the one who serves him thus is nonetheless liable.)]
12:31	You shall not do thus to the L rd your G d. For every abomination of the L rd, which He hates, did they do unto their gods. For even [(including their fathers and mothers)] their sons and their daughters did they burn in fire to their gods.
13
13:1	The entire thing that I command you ["light" as well as "weighty"], shall you take heed to do [A negative commandment is hereby superadded to each of the positive commandments mentioned above (but stripes do not obtain here, there being no stripes for the "take heed" of a positive commandment)]. You shall not add to it and you shall not diminish therefrom [See 4:2]
13:2	If there arise in your midst a prophet or a dreamer of dreams, and he give to you a sign [in the heavens] or a wonder [on earth],
13:3	And there shall materialize the sign and the wonder which he spoke to you, saying: Let us go after other gods, that you did not know, and let us serve them,
13:4	Do not pay heed to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams. For the L rd your G d is trying you to know whether you love the L rd your G d with all your heart and with all your soul.
13:5	After the L rd your G d shall you go, and Him shall you fear, and His mitzvoth [the Torah of Moses], shall you keep, and His voice [the voice of the prophets] shall you heed, and Him shall you serve [in His Temple], and to Him [i.e., to His ways] shall you cleave [(Be kind, bury the dead, visit the sick, as He did)].
13:6	And that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death. For of what is "removed" [from the world, it never having been created, and His never having been commanded by Me to speak thus] has he spoken of the L rd your G d — who took you out of the land of Egypt, and who redeemed you from the house of bondage. [Had He done only that, it should have been sufficient!] — to turn you from the way on which the L rd your G d commanded you to go. And you shall remove the evil from your midst.
13:7	If there incite you your brother [from your father] or the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend who is as your soul [i.e., your father (Scripture adduces those who are most beloved by you, how much more so others (who incite you thus!), in secret [(this being the common mode for such incitement)], saying: Let us go and serve other gods, which you did not know, neither you nor your fathers [(Even the heathens do not forsake what their fathers have bequeathed them — and this one bids you to do so!)]
13:8	Of the gods of the peoples around you, who are near to you or who are far from you [(Just as there is (manifestly) nothing to those near you, so there is nothing to those distant from you)], from one end of the earth [the sun, the moon, and the hosts of heaven (which go from one end of the world)] until the other —
13:9	You shall feel no affection for him, and you shall not hearken to him [when he pleads for his life], and your eye shall not be compassionate towards him, and you shall not pity [i.e., You shall not seek an "out" for him], and you shall not cover up for him [if you know something against him].
13:10	But kill shall you kill him [If he has left beth-din acquitted, return him for conviction; if he has left beth-din convicted, do not return him for acquittal.] Your hand shall be against him first to put him to death, and the hand of all the people afterwards. [It is a mitzvah for the one incited to put him to death; if he does not die by his hand, he is to die by the hand of others.]
13:11	And you shall stone him with stones and he shall die; for he sought to turn you from the L rd your G d, who took you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
13:12	And all of Israel shall hear and see, and they shall not do again according to this evil thing in your midst.
13:13	If you hear in one of your cities which the L rd your G d gives you to dwell there [(This excludes Jerusalem, which was not intended as a dwelling (for a particular tribe)], saying:
13:14	There have gone out men [(Women are excluded)], who have cast off the yoke [of Heaven] from your midst, and they have turned astray the dwellers of their city [(but not the dwellers of a different city)], saying: Let us go and serve other gods that you did not know,
13:15	Then you shall inquire, and you shall search out, and you shall ask well, and, behold, true and correct is the thing; this abomination has been done in your midst,
13:16	Smite shall you smite [(If you cannot administer the prescribed death, administer another)] the inhabitants of that city by the sword. Lay it waste, and all that is in it, and its beasts, by the sword.
13:17	And all of its spoil shall you gather into the midst of its square, and you shall burn with fire the city and all its spoil, entire, to the L rd your G d [i.e., in His name and for His sake]. And it shall be a heap forever; it shall not be built again.
13:18	And let naught from the spoil adhere to your hand, so that the L rd turn from the burning of His wrath [(For so long as idolatry is in the world, burning wrath is in the world)] and He will grant you mercy and He will be merciful to you and He will multiply you as He swore to your fathers,
13:19	When you hearken to the voice of the L rd your G d to keep all of His mitzvoth that I command you this day, to do what is just in the eyes of the L rd your G d.
14
14:1	Children are you to the L rd your G d. Do not lacerate yourselves [as the Emorites do (for you are children of the L rd, and it befits you to be comely and not lacerated and bald)], and do not make baldness between your eyes [opposite the forehead (see Leviticus 21:5)] for the dead.
14:2	For you are a holy people to the L rd your G d [by virtue of your fathers], and in you [in your own right] has the L rd chosen to be unto Him a chosen people from all the peoples that are on the face of the earth.
14:3	You shall not eat any abomination [i.e., anything that I rendered an abomination to you, e.g., cooking milk and meat together. (If you have performed this abomination, you may not eat it)].
14:4	This is the beast that you may eat: the ox, the lamb of sheep, and the kid of goats.
14:5	The hart, the gazelle, and the fallow deer [(whence it is derived that an animal is in the category of "beast" (4), and, also, that the unclean beasts and animals are more numerous than the clean, the lesser number always being specified)], and the wild goat, and the dyshon, and the wild ox, and the chamois.
14:6	And every beast that has split hooves, entirely cloven in two [(for there are those whose hooves are split but not entirely cloven)], and which chews the cud in the beast [(The implication is that what is found in the beast after slaughtering, i.e., a fetus, may be eaten without slaughtering)] — it shall you eat, [(but not an unclean beast (a positive commandment being superadded to the negative, in which instance the transgressor is liable for violation of both a positive and a negative commandment (See 20)].
14:7	Only this may you not eat of those which chew the cud and of those which have cloven hooves: the shesuah [a creature with two backs and two spines], the camel, the hare, and the coney, for they chew the cud but do not have cloven hooves. They are unclean to you. [The enumeration is repeated though given previously (Leviticus 11) — the beasts, because of the shesuah; and the birds, because of the ra'ah (13), both of which are not mentioned there.]
14:8	And the swine, for its hooves are cloven, but it does not chew the cud. It is unclean to you. Of their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcass you shall not touch [(on the festival, one being obliged to cleanse himself on a festival)].
14:9	This may you eat of all that is in the water: all that have fins and scales may you eat.
14:10	And whatever does not have fins and scales you may not eat; it is unclean to you.
14:11	Every clean bird you may eat [including that sent out by the leper (Leviticus 14:7)].
14:12	And this is what you may not eat of them [(including the slaughtered bird of the leper)]: the great vulture, the bearded vulture, and the osprey.
14:13	And the ra'ah, and the ayah, and the dayah after its kind. [Ra'ah, ayah, and dayah are one and the same. It is called "ra'ah," for it "sees" (roeh) very clearly. All of its names are given so as not to provide an opening for "objectors," one who forbids it calling it "ra'ah," and one who wishes to permit it calling it "dayah" or "ayah," saying that Scripture did not interdict the latter. (The unclean birds are enumerated, being fewer than the clean. See 5)]
14:14	And every raven after its kind.
14:15	And the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the sea-mew, and the hawk after its kind.
14:16	The little owl, and the great owl, and the tinshameth.
14:17	And the pelican, and the carrion-vulture, and the cormorant.
14:18	And the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.
14:19	And every creeping thing (sheretz) of the bird, [which moves on the ground, e.g., flies, hornets, and unclean hoppers] is unclean to you; they shall not be eaten.
14:20	All clean birds may you eat, [but not the unclean — a positive commandment superadded to the negative, in which instance the transgressor is liable for violation of both a positive and a negative commandment (see 6)].
14:21	You shall not eat any carcass. To the stranger in your gates, [a ger toshav (a "resident stranger"), one who has taken it upon himself not to serve idolatry, but who eats carcass] shall you give it, and he shall eat it; or sell it to the gentile. For you are a holy people to the L rd your G d [(Things which are permitted to you, and which others forbid to themselves, you are forbidden to permit in their presence.)] You shall not cook a kid in its mother's milk. [This is stated three times (here, Exodus 23:19, and 34:26), ("a kid"): excluding animals, birds, and unclean beasts)].
14:22	Tithe shall you tithe all the produce of your seed which goes forth from the field year by year [(whence it is derived that tithe is not taken from the new crop for the old)] [Re the juxtaposition with verse 21: The Holy One Blessed be He says, as it were, to Israel: If you do not give the tithe as prescribed, when it is close to ripening, you shall compel Me to blast the "kids" (i.e., the kernels) of the grain while they are yet in their mother's womb (i.e., the husks)].
14:23	And you shall eat [the second tithe (ma'aser sheni)] before the L rd your G d, in the place that He shall choose to repose His name there, the tithe of your corn, your wine, and your oil, and the firstlings of your herd and your flock, so that you learn to fear the L rd your G d all of the days.
14:24	And if the way be too long for you, so that you not be able to carry it, for the place be too far from you that the L rd your G d will choose to repose His name there, for the L rd your G d will bless you [that the produce be too much to carry] —
14:25	Then you shall change it to money, and you shall bind the money in your hand, and you shall go to the place that the L rd your G d chooses.
14:26	And you shall give the money for all that your soul desires ["general"], of herd, flock, wine, and strong drink ["particular"], and for all that your soul asks ["reversion to the general" — general-particular-general. The rule is in accordance with the particular, viz.: Just as the particular is: one fruit from another, originating from the earth (including animals, which derive their sustenance from the earth), so, everything of this nature (is purchasable with ma'aser money (Eruvin 27b)]. And you shall eat there before the L rd your G d, and you shall rejoice, you and your household.
14:27	And the Levite who is in your gate, you shall not forsake him [by not giving him first tithe (ma'aser rishon)], for he does not have a portion and an inheritance with you [(This excludes from the tithe: leket, shikchah, peah (see Leviticus 19) and hefker (ownerless produce); for he has a portion in them just as you do.)]
14:28	From the end of three years you shall remove all the tithe of your produce in that year, and you shall place it in your gates. [If one delayed giving his tithes of the first and second years of the shemitah period, he must remove them from the house in the third year.]
14:29	And the Levite shall come [and take ma'aser rishon], for he has no portion and inheritance with you, and the stranger and the orphan and the widow who are in your gates [They take the second tithe, which reverts to the poor in that year], and they shall eat and be sated [Give them as much as they need to be sated (and you go to Jerusalem with the tithe of the first and second years that you delayed and make confession: "I have removed the holy thing from the house" (Deuteronomy 26:13)], so that the L rd your G d bless you in all to which you put your hand.
15
15:1	From the end of seven years [of the reckoning of the shemitah period], you shall make shemitah (a release).
15:2	And this is the word of the shemitah: Every creditor shall release his claim against his neighbor. He shall not exact it of his neighbor and of his brother because it has been declared shemitah to the L rd.
15:3	Of the gentile shall you exact [(This is a positive commandment)], but what you have with your brother your hand shall release.
15:4	But there shall not be in you a pauper, [lacking everything. (If you do the will of the L rd, the paupers shall be in others but not in you; and if not, they shall be in you)]. For the L rd will bless you in the land which the L rd your G d gives you as an inheritance to inherit it.
15:5	[But there shall be no paupers in you] only if you hearken, hearken [(If you hearken somewhat, you will be enabled to hearken greatly)] to the voice of the L rd your G d, to observe to do this entire mitzvah that I command you this day.
15:6	For the L rd your G d has blessed you, as He spoke to you [viz. 28:3-12]. And you will lend to many nations, and you will not borrow [from one nation to pay the other], and you will rule many nations, and they [other nations] will not rule you.
15:7	If there be in you a pauper [(the neediest takes precedence)], of one of your brothers [(Your paternal brother takes precedence to your maternal brother)], in one of your gates [(The poor of your city take precedence to those of another)], in your land that the L rd your G d gives to you, do not harden your heart [in irresolution], and do not close your hand [after stretching it forth], to your brother the pauper [(If you do not give, in the end you will be a brother to the pauper)].
15:8	But open shall you open your hand to him [even many times], and lend shall you lend him [(If he refuses a gift, give it to him as a loan)] what suffices for his needs [(but you are not required to enrich him)] that are lacking [(even a horse to ride upon and a servant to run before him)] unto him [(even) a wife].
15:9	Take heed unto yourself lest there be in your heart a thing of wantonness, to say: The seventh year has drawn near, the year of shemitah, and your eye be evil against your brother the pauper, and you not give him, and he cry out against you to the L rd [(G d makes haste to exact payment when he "cries out")], there will be in you a sin [(even if he does not cry out)].
15:10	Give shall you give [(even a hundred times)] to him [privately], and let your heart not take it ill in giving to him, for because of this word [(Even if you say that you will give, you receive reward for saying along with that for giving)], the L rd your G d will bless you in all your deeds and in all to which you put your hand.
15:11	For a pauper will not cease from the midst of the land, wherefore I charge you [in good counsel, for your benefit]: Open shall you open your hand to your brother — your poor one and your pauper in your land.
15:12	If there be sold to you [(by beth-din, for his theft)], your brother, the Hebrew man, or [(if there be sold to you by her father, when she is a minor)] the Hebrew woman, then he shall serve you for six years; and on the seventh year you shall send him free from you [(and if the woman's six years expire before she shows pubertal signs, she leaves at that time)].
15:13	And when you send him free from you, do not send him empty-handed.
15:14	Bestow shall you bestow upon him [so that your "bestowal" is clearly visible], of your flock, of your threshing floor, and of your winepress — [Of all] that the L rd your G d has blessed you with shall you give him [Just as these ("flock, etc.") are characterized by "blessing" (i.e., fruitfulness), so (bestow upon him) all that are thus characterized — excluding mules (which are sterile)].
15:15	And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the L rd your G d redeemed you [and "bestowed" upon you, twice — from the spoils of Egypt and from the spoils of the sea]. Therefore, I command you in respect to this thing [(to bestow, likewise,)] this day.
15:16	And it shall be, if he say to you: I shall not leave you, because he loves you and your household, because it is good for him with you.
15:17	Then you shall take the awl and place it in his ear and in the door, and he shall be unto you a servant forever [i.e., until the Jubilee year]. And to your maid-servant, too, shall you do this [i.e., you shall "bestow" unto her (but she cannot become a servant forever)].
15:18	Let it not be difficult in your eyes when you send him away free from you, for double the hire of a hired man [day and night] has he served you for six years [(Aside from his day labor, his master gives him a Canaanite maid-servant to bear slaves for him)]. And the L rd your G d will bless you in all that you do.
15:19	Every firstling which is born in your herd and in your flock, the male, you shall consecrate to the L rd your G d [It is a mitzvah to say: "You are sanctified for the bechorah" (the mitzvah of the first-born)]. You shall not work with the firstling of your bullock and you shall not shear the firstling of your flock [(The converse is also forbidden, but the common instance is given)].
15:20	Before the L rd your G d shall you [the Cohein] eat it, year in year [It is a mitzvah to sacrifice and eat it in its first year. Also, if it were slaughtered at the end of the year, it may be eaten that day and one day of the next (whence it is derived that it may be eaten for two days and one night)], in the place that the L rd shall choose, you and your household.
15:21	And if there be in it a blemish ["general"], lame or blind ["particular"], any sore blemish ["reversion to the general" — Just as the particular specifies a visible blemish which never passes, so (all animals with) visible blemishes that never pass (are unfit for sacrifice)], you shall not sacrifice it to the L rd your G d.
15:22	In your gates may you eat it, the unclean and the clean together, as the deer and as the hart.
15:23	But its blood you shall not eat [(Even though it was originally forbidden and is now permitted, its blood remains forbidden)]; on the earth shall you spill it as water.
16
16:1	Observe the month of aviv [(Before its coming, observe that it be fit for aviv (spring), so that the omer meal-offering may be brought upon it; and if not, intercalate the year)], and make Pesach to the L rd your G d. For in the month of aviv the L rd your G d took you out of Egypt, [Pharaoh having acceded] at night [to your going].
16:2	And you shall sacrifice a Pesach offering to the L rd your G d, sheep [viz. (Exodus 12:5)] and cattle [shall you slaughter as a festival offering (chagigah), so that if a very large company is numbered over the (eating of the) pesach, a chagigah is brought so that it (the pesach) may be eaten in satiety)], in the place where the L rd shall choose to repose His name.
16:3	You shall not eat upon it chametz; seven days shall you eat upon it matzoth, the bread [which reminds you] of [the] affliction [that you underwent in Egypt], for in haste [the haste of the Egyptians] did you leave the land of Egypt, [and the dough had not time to leaven, and this (the matzoh) will serve as a reminder], so that you remember [by eating the pesach and the matzoh] the day of your leaving the land of Egypt all the days of your life.
16:4	And there shall not be seen unto you leaven in all of your border for seven days, and there shall not remain of the flesh [of the Pesach offering] that you sacrifice towards evening on the first day [the fourteenth of Nissan] until the morning.
16:5	You may not sacrifice the Pesach offering in one of your gates that the L rd your G d gives to you.
16:6	But in the place where the L rd your G d chooses to repose His name, there shall you sacrifice the Pesach offering in the evening [from the sixth hour on]; as the sun sets [shall you eat it, and] at the time of your going out of Egypt (i.e., in the morning) [if there is any flesh left over, you shall burn it (i.e., take it to the burning site for burning after the festival)].
16:7	And you shall cook [i.e., roast it] and eat it in the place that the L rd your G d has chosen, and you shall betake yourselves in the morning [of the second day (whence it is seen that they must spend the night there)], and you shall go to your tents.
16:8	Six days shall you eat matzoth [i.e., You may eat matzoth of the new grain (after the omer offering on the second day) and you may eat it seven days from the old grain], and on the seventh day is a holding back [from labor] for the L rd your G d; you shall do no work.
16:9	Seven weeks shall you count for yourself; from the beginning of the sickle in the standing corn [i.e., from the cutting of the omer, which is the beginning of the harvest] shall you begin to count seven weeks.
16:10	And you shall make a festival of weeks (shavuoth) to the L rd your G d, the sufficiency of the offering of your hand, which you shall give as the L rd your G d shall bless you [i.e., In accordance with the amplitude of His blessing, bring peace-offerings of joy and invite guests for the repast.]
16:11	And you shall rejoice before the L rd your G d: you — your son, your daughter, your man-servant, your maid-servant — the Levite that is in your gates, the stranger, the orphan, and the widow who are in your midst [(If you cause My four to rejoice, I shall cause your four to rejoice)], in the place where the L rd your G d shall choose to repose His name.
16:12	And you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and you shall keep and observe these statutes [i.e., it is to this end that I redeemed you].
16:13	The festival of succoth (booths) shall you make for yourself, seven days, when [i.e., at the time that] you gather in [to your house the summer fruits] from your threshing floor and from your winepress.
16:14	And you shall rejoice in your festival: you — your son, your daughter, your man-servant, your maid-servant — the Levite, the stranger, the orphan, and the widow, who are in your gates.
16:15	Seven days shall you rejoice before the L rd your G d in the place that the L rd chooses. For the L rd your G d will bless you in all of your produce and in all to which you put your hand, and you will be only happy.
16:16	Three times a year shall appear each of your males in the presence of the L rd your G d in the place that He chooses: on the festival of matzoth, and on the festival of Shavuoth, and on the festival of Succoth. And he shall not appear in the presence of the L rd empty-handed, [but he shall bring burnt-offerings of "appearance" and the peace-offerings of the festival].
16:17	Each according to the gift of his hand [(If one has much food and much property, he brings many burnt-offerings and peace-offerings)], according to the blessing of the L rd your G d that He has given you.
Shoftim
16:18	Judges and officers, [who enforce the rulings of the judges with "rod and strap"] shall you appoint for yourselves in all of your gates [i.e., in every city] that the L rd your G d gives you for your tribes [(Judges are appointed for each tribe and in each city)], and they shall judge the people a righteous judgment [i.e., Appoint expert, righteous judges, who will judge righteously.]
16:19	You shall not pervert judgment, and you shall not play favorites, [even during the pleading — an exhortation to the judge not to be firm with one and lenient with the other, e.g., making one stand and allowing the other to sit], and you shall not take a bribe [even to judge righteously]; for a bribe blinds the eyes of the sages [(Once the judge takes a bribe from someone it is impossible for him not to seek arguments in his favor)], and it distorts righteous words [i.e., true judgments].
16:20	Righteousness, righteousness shall you pursue [Seek out the finest beth-din], so that you live and inherit the land that the L rd your G d gives to you. [The appointment of fit judges serves to sustain Israel and to settle them in their land.]
16:21	You shall not plant for yourself an asheirah (a tree devoted to idolatry) [(One is liable from the time of planting)], any tree near the altar of the L rd your G d that you shall make for yourself [(an exhortation against planting a tree or building a house on the Temple Mount)].
16:22	And you shall not raise up for yourself a monument [one stone, on which to sacrifice (even to the L rd)], which the L rd your G d hates, [it having become an institution of idolatry].
17
17:1	You shall not sacrifice to the L rd your G d an ox or a lamb in which there is a blemish, any evil thing [(davar ra) an exhortation against invalidating sacrifices through evil speech (dibbur ra, see Leviticus 7:18)], for it is the abomination of the L rd your G d.
17:2	If there be found in your midst, in one of your cities which the L rd your G d gives you, a man or a woman who would do what is evil in the eyes of the L rd your G d to transgress His covenant [that He made with you — not to serve idolatry],
17:3	And he go and serve other gods and he bow down to them, or to the sun, or to the moon, or to the whole host of heaven, which I did not command [(that they be served)],
17:4	And it be told to you, and you hear, and you search it out well, and, behold, the thing is true and correct [i.e., the testimony bears it out] — this abomination has been done in Israel,
17:5	Then you shall take out that man or that woman, who did this evil thing, to your cities [where they committed the act], the man or the woman, and you shall stone them with stones and they shall die.
17:6	By the word of two witnesses or three witnesses shall the dead one be put to death [(Just as two constitute one testimony, so do three, and they do not become "scheming witnesses" (eidim zomemim) until all are shown to be so.)] He shall not be put to death by the word of one witness.
17:7	The hand of the witnesses shall be against him first to put him to death, and the hand of all the people afterwards, and you shall remove the evil from your midst.
17:8	If there be hidden from you a thing of judgment — between blood [that is unclean] and blood [that is clean], between ruling [of acquittal] and ruling [of liability], between plague-spot [that is unclean] and plague-spot [that is clean], words of contention in your gates, [the sages of the city disagreeing with each other], then you shall arise and go up to the place that the L rd your G d shall choose [(whence it is seen that the Temple is the highest of all the places)].
17:9	And you shall come to the Cohanim, the Levites [i.e., from the tribe of Levi], and to the judge that shall be in those days [(Even if he is inferior to his predecessors, you must abide by his ruling)], and you shall inquire, and they shall tell you the word of the judgment.
17:10	And you shall do according to the word that they shall tell you from that place which the L rd shall choose, and you shall observe to do according to all that they teach you.
17:11	According to the Torah that they teach you and the judgment that they tell you shall you do. You shall not turn aside from the thing that they tell you, right or left [(even if they tell you that right is left and left is right.)]
17:12	And the man who shall do wilfully, not to listen to the Cohein who stands there to serve the L rd your G d, or to the judge, that man shall die; and you shall remove the evil from Israel.
17:13	And all the people shall hear and fear [— whence it is derived that they wait for him (i.e., they wait to execute the rebellious elder) until the (next) festival, and they execute him during the (period of the) festival], and they shall not act wilfully again.]
17:14	When you come to the land which the L rd your G d gives to you and you inherit it and inhabit it, and you say: I shall place over myself a king, as all the nations that are around me,
17:15	Place shall you place over yourself a king whom the L rd your G d shall choose; from the midst of your brothers shall you place over yourself a king. You shall not be able to place over yourself a strange man, who is not your brother.
17:16	Only, he shall not multiply for himself horses, [but only what he needs for his chariots], so that he not return the people to Egypt [the center of horses], to add a horse, the L rd having said to you: You shall not venture to return upon this way anymore.
17:17	And he shall not multiply for himself wives [(beyond eighteen)], that his heart not turn astray, and silver and gold he shall not multiply for himself overmuch, [but only as much as he needs to maintain his army].
17:18	And it shall be, when, [as a reward for fulfilling the above,] he sits [secure] on his throne of kingdom, then he shall write for himself a double of this Torah [i.e., two Torah scrolls: one to be reposited in his treasury, and one to accompany him constantly] on a scroll from before the Cohanim, the Levites.
17:19	And it shall be with him and he shall read in it all the days of his life, so that he learn to fear the L rd his G d, to heed all the words of this Torah and these statutes to do them.
17:20	So that his heart not rise above his brothers, and so that he not depart from the mitzvah, [even a "light" mitzvah of a prophet], right or left, so that he prolong days in his kingdom [(But "departing," he shall not prolong days, e.g., I Samuel 10:8, 13:8 and 13-14)], he and his sons, in the midst of Israel [(If his son is fit to rule, he takes precedence to others.)]
18
18:1	There shall not be to the Cohanim, the Levites, the entire tribe of Levi, [both the unblemished and the blemished], a portion [in the spoils] and an inheritance [in the land] with Israel. The fire-offerings of the L rd [the Temple offerings] and His inheritance [the boundary offerings, i.e., terumoth and ma'asroth] shall they eat,
18:2	But he shall not have an [absolute] inheritance in the midst of his brothers; the L rd is his inheritance, as He spoke to him [(Numbers 18:20)].
18:3	And this shall be the judgment for the Cohanim from the people, [but not from the Cohanim (who slaughter for themselves)]. From the slaughterers of the slaughtering, whether ox or sheep [Animals (as opposed to beasts) are excluded], he shall give to the Cohein the shoulder [(from the knee-joint to the shoulder blade)], the cheeks [with the tongue], and the maw.
18:4	The first [i.e., terumah] of your corn, your wine, and your oil, and the first of the [annual] shearing of your flock shall you give to him.
18:5	For in him did the L rd your G d choose from all of your tribes to stand and minister [(whence it is derived that the ministrant must stand)] in the name of the L rd, he and his sons all of the days.
18:6	And if the Levite [i.e., a Cohein] come from one of your cities, from all of Israel, wherein he lives, and he come in all the desire of his soul [to sacrifice his gift or obligatory offerings] to the place that the L rd shall choose,
18:7	then, [even if his watch is not officiating], he shall minister in the name of the L rd his G d, as all of his brothers, the Levites, [i.e., the Cohanim] who stand there before the L rd.
18:8	Portion [of the hides (of the burnt-offerings) and the flesh of the he-goat sin-offerings] as portion shall they eat [along with the Cohanim of the watch], except for the sale of the fathers [i.e., those sacrifices offered not by virtue of the festival, e.g., the temidin, the mussafin of Shabbath, and gift and vow offerings, the rights to which were sold by their fathers in the days of David and Samuel, when the rotation of priestly watches was instituted].
18:9	When you come to the land that the L rd your G d gives to you, do not learn to do as the abominations of those nations [(but you may learn to understand the falsity of their ways and to teach your children, by identifying them as heathen practices, not to emulate them.)]
18:10	There shall not be found among you one who passes his son or daughter through fire [This is the service of the Molech (see Leviticus 18:21)], a diviner of divinations [one who "divines" by holding his stick, whether to go or not to go], a me'onein [one who assigns an auspicious "time" (onah) for a particular undertaking], a necromancer [one who interprets natural happenings as signs and portents], and a sorcerer.
18:11	A chover chaver [one who "congregates" snakes or scorpions and the like into one spot], a shoel ov [one who raises the spirit of the dead, which speaks from his arm-pit], a yidoni [(see Leviticus 19:31)], and one who inquires of the dead [e.g., via a skull].
18:12	For the abomination of the L rd are all who do [(even one of)] these, and because of these abominations the L rd your G d drives them out before you.
18:13	Whole shall you be with the L rd your G d [i.e., If you repose all of your trust in Him, without probing the future, but accepting wholeheartedly all that befalls you, then you shall be "with the L rd your G d," and His portion.]
18:14	For these nations that you inherit hearken to me'onenim (see 10) and to diviners; but you, not thus [to hearken to them] did the L rd your G d relegate you, [for He reposed His shechinah on the prophets and the urim vethumim.]
18:15	A prophet from your midst, from your brothers, such as I [i.e., just as I am from your midst and from your brothers] shall the L rd your G d raise up for you [in my place, and so, from prophet to prophet]; to him shall you hearken.
18:16	As all that you asked from the L rd your G d in Chorev, on the day of the assembly, saying: I shall not continue hearing the voice of the L rd my G d, and this great fire I shall see no more, that I not die.
18:17	And the L rd said to me: They have done well in speaking as they did.
18:18	A prophet shall I raise up for them from the midst of their brothers, such as you, and I shall place My words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him.
18:19	And it shall be, the man who will not heed My words, which he shall speak in My name, I shall require it of him. [One who suppresses his prophecy, one who transgresses the words of a prophet, and a prophet who transgresses his own words incur death at the hands of Heaven.]
18:20	But the prophet who shall presume to speak a thing in My name which I did not command him to speak [(but which I commanded his fellow prophet)], and one who speaks in the name of other gods, [even if he is in agreement with the halachah, forbidding what is forbidden, and permitting what is permitted], that prophet shall be put to death [by strangulation. Three incur death by strangulation: one who prophesies what he did not hear, one who prophesies what was told to his fellow, and one who prophesies in the name of idolatry.]
18:21	And when you say in your heart, [as you will in the incident of Chananiah ben Azur and Jeremiah (see Jeremiah 27:16, 19-22)]: How shall we know the thing which the L rd has not spoken?
18:22	What the prophet shall speak in the name of the L rd [i.e., "This and this shall happen to you"] and the thing not be and not come to pass, that is the thing which the L rd has not spoken, [and put him to death. (For an instance in which he says: "The L rd has told me to tell you to do thus and thus," see 13:9 and 15 above)]. In presumption has the prophet spoken it; do not hold back from [incriminating] him [and do not fear incurring punishment because of him].
19
19:1	When the L rd your G d cuts off the nations whose land the L rd your G d gives to you, and you inherit them and you dwell in their cities and in their houses,
19:2	Three cities shall you set aside for yourself in the midst of your land which the L rd your G d gives you to inherit.
19:3	Prepare for yourself the way [("Refuge" signs were posted on the crossroads)], and "third" the border of your land that the L rd your G d will cause you to inherit, [so that there be equal distances from the beginning of the border to the first city of refuge, from there to the second city, from there to the third city, and from there to the second border of Eretz Yisrael], that every slayer may flee there.
19:4	And this is the matter of the slayer who shall flee there and live: one who smites his neighbor unwittingly, not having hated him in the past,
19:5	And one who comes with his neighbor in the forest to chop wood, and his hand swing the axe to cut the tree, and the blade slip from the haft [or, "and the blade chip (aught) of the tree"], and it (the blade or the chip) find his neighbor and he die — he shall flee to one of these cities, and he shall live.
19:6	[I tell you to prepare the way (3) and numerous cities of refuge] lest the avenger of blood pursue the slayer, his heart being hot, and he overtake him, the way being long, and he smite him mortally, and he (the slayer) not deserve to die, not having hated him (the victim) in the past.
19:7	Therefore, I command you, saying: Three cities shall you set aside for yourself.
19:8	And if the L rd your G d broaden your borders, as He swore to your forefathers [to give you the land of the Keini, the Kenizi, and the Kadmoni (Genesis 15:9)], and He give you all the land that He said to give to your forefathers,
19:9	If you keep all of this mitzvah to do it, that I command you this day, to love the L rd your G d and to walk in His ways all of the days — then you shall add for yourself another three cities to these three [— nine in all: three across the Jordan, three in the land of Canaan, and three in time to come].
19:10	And innocent blood shall not be shed in the midst of your land that the L rd your G d gives to you as an inheritance, and there be blood upon you.
19:11	And if a man hate his neighbor, [(transgressing Leviticus 19:17)], and he lie in wait for him [(transgression of a "light" commandment leading to transgression of a grave one)], and he rise up against him, and he smite him mortally, and he die, and he flees to one of these cities,
19:12	Then the elders of his city shall send, and they shall take him from there, and they shall put him into the hand of the avenger of blood, and he shall die.
19:13	Let your eye not pity him [(Do not say: One has already been killed — why kill two Jews?], and remove the innocent blood from Israel, and it shall be good for you.
19:14	You shall not move back [(into his land, thus broadening your own)], the boundary marker of your neighbor [(If you do so, you violate two negative commandments — this and (Leviticus 19:13): "You shall not rob")], which the first ones bounded, in your inheritance which you shall inherit in the land which the L rd your G d gives you to inherit. [(Outside of Eretz Yisrael one is in violation only of "You shall not rob")].
19:15	One witness shall not arise against a man for every transgression and for every sin, in any sin that one commit. By the mouth of two witnesses, [and not by sending written testimony to beth-din, and not by interposing an interpreter between the witnesses and the judges], or by the mouth of three witnesses shall a thing be established.
19:16	If there arise a false witness [i.e., a false set of witnesses] against a man to testify against him, removed, [i.e., when they were completely removed from having witnessed the incident (as when other witnesses challenge them: But were you not with us at this and this place at that time!)],
19:17	Then the two men [the witnesses] shall stand [(Witnesses must be men and they must testify standing)], (and those men) who have the contention (must stand) before the L rd [(It should be in their eyes as if they are standing "before the L rd")], before the Cohanim and the judges who shall be in those days [("Yiftach in his generation is like Samuel in his generation.")]
19:18	And the judges shall inquire well [by cross-examining those who come to discredit the witnesses], and, behold, a false witness is the witness [("witness" always connotes two)] — falsely did he testify against his brother,
19:19	Then you shall do to him as he schemed to do [(but not "as he did")] to his brother, [but not to his sister (in an instance of their testifying that the married daughter of a Cohein was adulterous, in which instance they receive not the adulteress's penalty (burning), but the adulterer's (strangulation)], and you shall remove the evil from your midst.
19:20	And the rest shall hear and fear, and they shall not venture to do again as this evil thing in your midst. [Scheming witnesses require "proclamation," viz.: "These men were executed for having been found 'scheming witnesses' in beth-din."]
19:21	And let your eyes not pity. A soul for a soul, an eye for an eye [i.e., monetary compensation (and so with what follows)], a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot.
20
20:1	When you go out to war [(the rationale of the juxtaposition: one lacking a limb does not go out to war)], against your foes [(Let them be as foes in your eyes: Do not pity them, for they will not pity you)], and you see horse and chariot [(In My eyes they are all like one horse)], a nation greater 'from you' [i.e., from your vantage point, not from Mine], do not fear them; for the L rd your G d is with you, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.
20:2	And it shall be, when you draw near to the battle [soon after leaving the boundary of your land], that the Cohein [the Cohein "anointed for war"] shall come forward, and he shall speak to the people [in the holy tongue].
20:3	And he shall say to them: Hear, (Shema) O Israel [(Even if you had no other merit but that of reciting the Shema, it would suffice for your salvation)], you are drawing near today to do battle with your foes, [and not with your brethren, who would treat you with compassion (see II Chronicles 28:15)]. Let your hearts not faint [at the whinnying of the foes' horses], do not fear [the clashing of their shields], do not tremble [at the blaring of their trumpets], and do not break before them [i.e., before their battle cries].
20:4	For it is the L rd your G d [(They come with the triumph of flesh and blood, and you come with the triumph of the L rd)] which [viz., the encampment of the ark] goes with you to war for you with your foes, to save you.
20:5	Then [the Cohanim shall say to the officers and] the officers shall speak to the people, saying: Who is the man that has built a new house and has not inhabited it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the war and another man inhabit it [and the thought of this happening cause him distress].
20:6	And who is the man that has planted a vineyard and not redeemed it [in the fourth year (the fruits to be eaten in Jerusalem or redeemed for money to be spent for eating in Jerusalem)]? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the war and another man redeem it.
20:7	And who is the man who has betrothed a woman and not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the war [(If he does not heed the Cohein, he deserves to die)], and another man take her.
20:8	Then the officers shall add [to the words of the Cohanim] to speak to the people, and they shall say: Who is the man that fears [According to one view, fear of combat; according to another, fear of (dying in battle because of) one's transgressions], and that is faint of heart? Let him go and return to his house and not melt the heart of his brothers as his own heart.
20:9	And it shall be, when the officers finish speaking to the people, that they shall post sentinels at the head of the people, [before and behind, with iron staves in their hands, and empowered to "cripple" all who would flee, for the beginning of defeat is flight.]
20:10	If [in an optional war (as opposed to a war of mitzvah)] you draw near to a city to do battle with it, then you shall call out to it for peace.
20:11	And it shall be, if it answers you for peace and opens itself to you, then all the people found in it [even those of the seven nations, whom you are (otherwise) commanded to destroy] shall be tribute to you and they shall serve you [They must accede to both.]
20:12	But if it does not make peace with you, and it makes war with you [(If it does not make peace with you and you let it be, in the end it will make war with you)], then you shall besiege it, [even to cause famine, thirst, and mortal disease],
20:13	And the L rd your G d will deliver it into your hands [if you do as you have been charged], and you shall smite all of its [adult] males by the sword.
20:14	But the women, and the little ones, and the beasts, and all that is in the city, all of its spoil, shall you take for yourself, and you shall eat the spoil of your foes, which the L rd your G d has given you.
20:15	So shall you do to all the cities which are very far from you, which are not of the cities of these nations.
20:16	But from the cities of these people which the L rd your G d gives you as an inheritance you shall not allow any soul to live.
20:17	But you shall utterly destroy them: the Chitti, the Emori, the Canaani, the Perizi, the Chivi, and the Yevussi, as the L rd your G d commanded you [(The Girgashi is hereby included)].
20:18	So that they not teach you to do according to all their abominations which they performed unto their gods and you sin to the L rd your G d [(but if they repent and convert, you may accept them)].
20:19	If you besiege a city [(in an optional war)] many days [("days" = two; "many days" = three — whence it is derived that gentile cities are not besieged fewer than three days before the Sabbath and that the peace overture is repeated for two or three days)], to make war upon it, to capture it, do not destroy its tree by wielding an axe against it. For from it shall you eat, but it shall you not cut down. For is the tree of the field a man, to come before you into the siege, [there to be afflicted with hunger and thirst like the people of the city? Why should you destroy it?]
20:20	Only a tree that you know not to be a food tree, it may you destroy and cut down and build siegeworks against the city that makes war with you until it is subdued.
21
21:1	If there be found a slain body on the land that the L rd your G d gives you to inherit, fallen in the field, it not being known who killed him,
21:2	Then there shall go out your elders [the Great Sanhedrin] and your judges, and they shall measure [from the body] to the cities that are around the body [to determine which is closest].
21:3	And it shall be, the city closest to the body — the elders of that city shall take a heifer that has not been worked, that has not drawn under the yoke,
21:4	And the elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a hard [unworked] river-bed, which shall not be worked and which shall not be sown, and they shall break there [with a hatchet] the neck of the heifer in the river-bed. [The Holy One Blessed be He says: Let a one-year-old heifer, which has produced no fruits, come and be broken in a place which produces no fruits to atone for the slaying of this one, who was not permitted to produce fruits.]
21:5	Then there shall draw near, the Cohanim, the sons of Levi; for them did the L rd your G d choose to serve Him and to pronounce the benediction in the name of the L rd; and by their word shall every contention and every plague-spot be (ruled upon).
21:6	And all the elders of that city who are near to the slain one shall wash their hands over the heifer of the broken neck in the river-bed.
21:7	And they shall raise their voices and say: Our hands have not spilled this blood and our eyes did not see [i.e., We did not see him and let him go without food and without escort].
21:8	[And the Cohanim say:] Atone for Your people, Israel, which You have redeemed, O L rd, and do not place innocent blood in the midst of Your people, Israel; and the blood will be atoned unto them [i.e., If they do as prescribed, the sin will be atoned.]
21:9	And you shall remove the innocent blood from your midst by doing what is just in the eyes of the L rd. [If the slayer is found after the heifer's neck is broken, he is to be put to death, this being "what is just in the eyes of the L rd."]
Ki Tetze
21:10	If you go out to war [an optional war (as opposed to a war of mitzvah)] against your enemy, and the L rd your G d delivers him into your hand and you capture its captivity, [including Canaanites in their midst, even if they be of the seven nations],
21:11	And you see in the captivity a woman [(even a married woman)] of beautiful form, and you desire her, then you may take her for yourself as a wife [(Scripture here speaks vis-à-vis the evil inclination. If the L rd did not permit her, he would marry her illicitly. (But if he does marry her, he is destined to hate her and to beget of her a rebellious son (see 14-18), for which reason these sections are juxtaposed)].
21:12	And you shall bring her inside your house, and she shall shave her head and she shall do her nails. [She shall let them grow long so that she becomes unsightly.]
21:13	And she shall remove the garment of her captivity from her, [(the gentile women adorning themselves in war to lure others to live with them)], and she shall sit in your house, [the house that he frequents, so that he see her constantly in her weeping and in her unsightliness and she become repulsive to him], and she shall mourn her father and her mother a month of days [All this, so that a Jewess appear happy to him, and this one, sad; a Jewess, attractive, and this one, repulsive]. And afterwards, you may come to her and cohabit with her, and she shall be to you as a wife.
21:14	And it shall be, when you do not desire her [(Scripture indicates that he is destined to hate her)], that you shall release her. But you shall not sell her for money. You may not exploit her after you have afflicted her.
21:15	If there be to a man two wives, one, beloved; the other, hated, and they bear him sons, the loved one and the hated one, and the first-born son be the hated one's,
21:16	Then it shall be, on the day that he causes his sons to inherit what there shall be to him, he shall not be able to grant primogeniture to the son of the beloved one over the son of the hated one, the first-born.
21:17	But the first-born, the son of the hated one, shall he recognize, to give him a double portion [i.e., the portion of two brothers] of all that shall be found with him [at the time of his death (and not what is destined to come to him after his death)]. For he is the first of his strength; his is the judgment of the first-born.
21:18	If there be to a man a son who turns aside [from the right path], and is recalcitrant, not heeding the voice of his father and the voice of his mother, and they chastise him [i.e., they warn him before three, and he receives stripes], and he not heed them,
21:19	Then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and they shall take him out to the elders of his city and to the gate of his place.
21:20	And they shall say to the elders of his city: This son of ours turns aside and is recalcitrant, not heeding our voice, a glutton and a guzzler,
21:21	Then all the people of his city shall stone him with stones and he shall die, and you shall remove the evil from your midst [(The Torah "probed to the end of the mind" of the rebellious son. In the end he would exhaust his father's money. Lacking his accustomed fare, he would become a highway man and would rob (and kill). The Torah says: Let him die unincriminated rather than incriminated)], and all of Israel shall hear and fear. [Proclamation is required, viz.: "This man was stoned for being a rebellious son!"]
21:22	And if there be in a man a sin whose judgment is death [(the rationale of the juxtaposition: If the rebellious son is pitied by his parents, in the end he will become corrupt and commit transgressions for which he will be sentenced to death by beth-din)], then he shall be put to death, and you shall hang him [i.e., his body, after stoning] on a tree.
21:23	You shall not leave his body overnight on the tree, but you shall bury it that day, for the demeaning of G d is [his remaining] hanging, [man being G d's image, and the children of Israel, His sons], and you shall not make unclean your land, which the L rd your G d gives you as an inheritance.
22
22:1	You shall not see the ox of your brother or his lamb straying and ignore them; but you shall return them to your brother.
22:2	And if your brother is not near to you, and you do not know him, then you shall gather it into the midst of your house, and it shall be with you until you make inquiry of your brother concerning it [when he comes to claim it, to ascertain that his claims are legitimate], and you shall return it to him [(It must constitute a "return"; do not feed it as much as it is worth and then claim that amount from the owner. But if its work can compensate for its food, then let it work; if not, sell it and give that money to the owner.)]
22:3	And so shall you do with his ass, and so shall you do with his garment, and so shall you do with every lost object of your brother which shall go lost from him and you find it; you shall not be able to ignore it.
22:4	You shall not see the ass of your brother or his ox fallen on the way and ignore them; raise shall you raise [the animal's fallen load] with him [the owner. (If he himself does not care to do so, you are exempt.)]
22:5	A man's garment shall not be upon a woman, [making her appear like a man, so that she can mix with them, this being a ploy for promiscuity], and a man shall not wear a woman's garment [in order to mix with them], for the abomination of the L rd your G d are all who do these [(The Torah forbade only a garment which leads to "abomination.")]
22:6	If there chance before you a bird's nest on the way [(This excludes what is already at hand (i.e., domesticated fowl)] on any tree or on the ground, fledglings or eggs, the mother bird lying upon the fledglings or upon the eggs — you shall not take the mother bird while she is yet on the young.
22:7	Send shall you send away the mother bird and the young shall you take for yourself, so that it shall be good for you and you prolong days [(a fortiori, the granting of reward for the observance of more onerous mitzvoth)].
22:8	[The rationale of the juxtaposition of the verses that follow: If you fulfill the mitzvah of sending away the mother bird, in the end, you will build a new house and fulfill the mitzvah of making a railing, (for one mitzvah brings another in its train), and you will attain to a vineyard, and a field, and beautiful garments.] If you build a new house, you shall make a railing for your roof, and you shall not place blood in your house when the faller falls from it. [He deserves to fall (in terms of G d's judgment) notwithstanding which, let his falling not be occasioned by you, (merit being occasioned by the meritorious one, and liability by him who is liable)].
22:9	You shall not sow your vineyard with mixed seed [wheat, barley, and grain kernels with one hand-throw], lest there be rejected the fullness [i.e., the growth] of the seed which you shall sow and the produce of the vineyard.
22:10	You shall not plow [(The same applies to leading them tied together in the carrying of any load)] with an ox and an ass together [(The same applies to any two different kinds of animals)]
22:11	You shall not wear sha'atnez [a mixture], wool and linen together.
22:12	Fringes shall you make for yourself [(even from sha'atnez — hence the juxtaposition)] on the four corners of your garment wherewith you cover yourself.
22:13	If a man take a wife, and he come upon her, and he hate her,
22:14	And he libel her and give out about her an evil name [(Transgression brings transgression in its wake — If he transgresses (Leviticus 19:17): "You shall not hate," in the end he comes to slander)], and he says: This woman [(whence it is derived that the charge must be made in the presence of the defendant)], I took, and I drew near to her, and I did not find in her, virginity,
22:15	Then the father of the maiden and her mother shall take [("Let the rearers of the evil sprout be shamed by it" (Had she been completely virtuous she would not have been suspected)], and they shall bring out the virgin signs of the maiden to the elders of the city to the gate.
22:16	And the father of the maiden shall say to the elders [(whence it is seen that a woman is not permitted to speak up when her husband is present (to do so)]: My daughter did I give to this man as a wife, and he hated her.
22:17	And, behold, he has uttered a libel, saying: I did not find your daughter to be a virgin — and these are the virgin signs of my daughter. And they shall spread the garment before the elders of the city [i.e., They shall make her innocence of the accusation as manifest as a spread-out garment.]
22:18	Then the elders of he city shall take the man and chastise him [with stripes].
22:19	And they shall fine him a hundred (shekels of) silver, and they shall give it to the father of the maiden, for he has given out an evil name about a virgin of Israel; and to him shall she be as a wife. He shall not be able to send her away all of his days.
22:20	And if the matter were true, [(witnesses and prior warning obtaining that she had been adulterous after betrothal)] — if virginity were not found in the maiden,
22:21	Then they shall take out the maiden to the door of her father's house [("See the sprout that you have reared!")], and the men of her city shall stone her with stones [i.e., she shall be stoned in the presence of all the men of the city], and she shall die, for she has done a vile thing in Israel, to harlotize [while in] her father's house; and you shall remove the evil from your midst.
22:22	If there be found a man lying with a woman who had been cohabited with by a husband, then there shall be put to death, also both of them [("both of them") excluding an act of (self-) arousal (by the man), from which she derives no gratification, and ("also") including those who come (and cohabit with them) after they had been sentenced)], the man who lay with the woman, and the woman; and you shall remove the evil from Israel.
22:23	If there be a maiden, a virgin, betrothed to a man, and a man find her in the city and lie with her [("The breach calls to the thief" — If she remained at home, this would not happen)] —
22:34	Then you shall take out both of them to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them with stones, and they shall die — the maiden, because she did not cry out in the city, and the man, because he afflicted his neighbor's wife; and you shall remove the evil from your midst.
22:25	And if in the field the man find the betrothed maiden, and the man seize her and lie with her, then the man who lay with her, alone, shall be put to death.
22:26	But to the maiden shall you not do a thing; the maiden does not have a sin of death. For as a man would rise up against his neighbor and slay him, so is this thing [i.e., she was forced and is, therefore, guiltless].
22:27	For in the field did he find her. The betrothed maiden called out and no one could save her.
22:28	If a man find a maiden, a virgin, who was not betrothed, and he seize her and lie with her, and they are found,
22:29	Then the man who lies with her shall give to the father of the maiden fifty (shekels of) silver, and to him shall she be as a wife because he afflicted her; he shall not be able to send her away all of his days.
23
23:1	A man shall not take his father's wife [(Marriage does not "take" in her)], and he shall not uncover his father's lap [i.e., a woman who awaits his father for levirate marriage (shomereth yavam). One who lies with his father's shomereth yavam is hereby made subject to two negative commandments — this and Leviticus 18:14. And the juxtaposition with verse 3 indicates that only the issue of kareth relationships (like that of a shomereth yavam) is a mamzer — a fortiori, the issue of those relationships punishable by death, all such relationships being punishable by kareth (in the absence of warning)].
23:2	A petzua dakkah [one whose testicles have been maimed or crushed] and a keruth shafchah [one whose membrum is cut, so that the sperm is not ejected but drips, obviating conception] shall not come into the congregation of the L rd.
23:3	A mamzer (see 1) shall not come into the congregation of the L rd [i.e., he may not marry an Israelite woman]. Even the tenth generation shall not come for him into the congregation of the L rd.
23:4	An Ammonite and a Moavite shall not come into the congregation of the L rd [i.e., they may not marry Israelite women]. Even the tenth generation shall not come for them into the congregation of the L rd, forever.
23:5	Because of the word [i.e., the counsel which they gave to entice you into sin, and] because they did not go out before you with bread and water [when you were spent] on the way when you came out of Egypt, and because he hired against you Bilam the son of Beor from Pethor, Aram Naharayim, to curse you.
23:6	And the L rd your G d did not desire to heed Bilam, and the L rd your G d turned the curse into a blessing for you, for the L rd your G d loved you.
23:7	You shall not seek their peace and their good all of your days, forever [(as opposed to 17 below)].
23:8	You shall not [entirely] abominate an Edomi [even though he came out with a sword against you (Numbers 20:18-20)], for he is your brother. You shall not [entirely] abominate an Egyptian, [even though they cast your males into the Nile], for you were a stranger in his land [and they were your hosts in your extremity].
23:9	Children which will be born to them, the third generation, shall come for them into the congregation of the L rd, [and the other nations are permitted immediately — whence it is seen that one who causes a Jew to sin (4) is worse than one who kills him, the latter killing him only in this world, but the former removing him from both worlds.]
23:10	When you go out as an encampment against your enemies, then you shall guard yourself against every evil thing, [the Satan "prosecuting" in time of danger.]
23:11	If there be among you a man who shall not be clean because of a nocturnal accident [(Scripture speaks of the common instance)], then he shall go outside the camp [(a positive commandment)]; he shall not come into the midst of the camp [(a negative commandment. He may not enter the camp of the Levites — a fortiori, the camp of the Shechinah.]
23:12	And it shall be towards evening that he shall bathe in water [(He should immerse himself close to sunset, for he is not clean until sunset)], and when the sun sets, he may come into the midst of the camp.
23:13	And a place shall there be for you outside the camp [outside of the cloud of glory], and you shall go out there, outside.
23:14	And you shall have a spade, aside from your other implements, and it shall be, when you sit outside, that you shall dig with it, and you shall turn back and cover your excrement.
23:15	For the L rd your G d walks in the midst of your camp to save you and to deliver your foes before you. And let your camp be holy, that He not see in you a thing of nakedness and turn away from you.
23:16	You shall not hand over a slave [of the nations] to his master, who escaped to you from his master.
23:17	With you shall he dwell, in your midst, in the place that he chooses, in one of your gates where it is good for him; you shall not oppress him.
23:18	There shall be no harlot from the daughters of Israel, and there shall be no harlot [for sodomy] from the sons of Israel.
23:19	You shall not bring the hire of a prostitute [(If one gave her a lamb as her hire, it is unfit for sacrifice)] and the exchange of a dog [i.e., a lamb exchanged for a dog] into the house of the L rd your G d for every vow; for the abomination of the L rd your G d are also both (shneihem). [Shinuyeihem ("their changes," e.g., wheat converted into flour) are also included as forbidden.]
23:20	You shall not give interest to your brother [(an exhortation to the borrower not to give interest to the lender (and see Leviticus 25:37)]: interest of money, interest of food, interest of any thing that can be (construed as) interest.
23:21	To the stranger shall you give interest [and not to your brother (a negative commandment inferred from a positive commandment, hence, a positive commandment — making him liable, in sum, for transgression of two negative commandments, (what follows and 20 above) and a positive commandment)]; but to your brother shall you not give interest, so that the L rd your G d will bless you in all to which you put your hand on the land whither you are coming to inherit it.
23:22	If you make a vow to the L rd your G d, you shall not delay [beyond the space of three festivals] to pay it; for the L rd your G d will require it of you and it will be a sin in you.
23:23	But if you forbear to vow, it will not be a sin in you.
23:24	What issues from your lips shall you observe and you shall do, as you vowed to the L rd your G d, the pledge that you spoke with your mouth.
23:25	If you [a worker] come into the vineyard of your neighbor, you may eat grapes as [much as] you desire, to satiety [but not overmuch], but into your (own) vessel you shall not place (any). [Scripture is speaking of harvest time, when the worker places (grapes) into the owner's vessel.]
23:26	If you [a worker] come into the standing corn of your neighbor, then you may pluck ears with your hand; but you shall not lift a sickle upon your neighbor's standing corn.
24
24:1	If a man take a woman, and he cohabit with her, then it shall be, if she does not find favor in his eyes, his having found in her a thing of nakedness, he shall write her a scroll of divorce [(it is a mitzvah for him to do so)], and he shall place it into her hand, and he shall send her from his house.
24:2	And she shall go out of his house, and she shall go and be (a wife) to another man [i.e., he is different from the first, who cast a wicked woman from his house].
24:3	And the second man shall hate her [(This is a prognostication)], and he shall write her a scroll of divorce and place it into her hand, and he shall send her from his house. And if [(as will happen if he does not divorce her)] the second man die, who had taken her for himself as a wife,
24:4	Her first husband who had sent her away shall not be able to return to take her to be to him as a wife after she has been defiled [(This includes a sotah who had secreted herself)], for she is an abomination before the L rd. And you shall not make sinful the land which the L rd your G d gives you as an inheritance.
24:5	If a man take a new wife [one who is new to him, even a widow; but not a returned divorcée, he shall not go out in the army, and it (the army) shall not impose on him for any thing [needed by the army, such as supplying food and water and repairing roads (as opposed to those who are released by mandate of the Cohein, 20:5-7)]. Free shall he be [also] for his house [i.e., If he built a house and dedicated it or planted a vineyard and redeemed it, he does not stir thence because of army exigencies] for one year. And he shall rejoice his wife whom he has taken.
24:6	One shall not take as a pledge [for a debt, in beth-din, something essential to the debtor's livelihood], a nether millstone nor an upper millstone; for it is a soul that he takes in pledge.
24:7	If there be found a man [(where there are witnesses and warning)] who steals a soul of his brothers of the children of Israel, and he exploits him [(He is not liable until he makes use of him)], and he sells him, then that thief shall die, and you shall remove the evil from your midst.
24:8	Be heedful of the plague-spot of leprosy to take great care [not to pluck out the signs of uncleanliness and not to cut the bahereth (see Leviticus 13:2)], and to do according to all that the Cohanim, the Levites, teach you, [whether to quarantine, to confirm, or to declare clean]. As I have commanded them, so shall you observe to do.
24:9	Remember what the L rd your G d did to Miriam on the way when you went out of Egypt, [i.e., His striking her with leprosy for slandering Moses (— If you would avoid leprosy, avoid slander)].
24:10	When you claim from your neighbor any kind of debt, do not enter his house to claim his pledge.
24:11	Outside shall you stand, and the man who is indebted to you shall take out the pledge to you outside.
24:12	And if he is a poor man, you shall not lie down with his pledge [in your possession].
24:13	Return shall you return to him the pledge when the sun goes down [if it is a night garment (and see Exodus 22:25)], so that he may sleep in his garment, and he shall bless you; and [even if he does not bless you], it shall be (accounted) righteousness for you before the L rd your G d.
24:14	You shall not oppress a hired laborer who is poor and needy, of your brothers [(One who does so transgresses two negative commandments, this and Leviticus 19:13)], or of your stranger [a righteous convert] that is in your land [(Withholding the hire of animals and utensils is hereby included)], in your gates [(a resident stranger, one who eats carrion)].
24:15	In his day shall you give his wage, and the sun shall not go down upon it; for he is poor and to it [his wage] he bears his soul [risking death in his work] — that he not call against you to the L rd; and there will be in you a sin, [in any event, even if he does not call, (but calling hastens punishment)].
24:16	Fathers shall not be put to death by [the testimony of] sons; and sons shall not be put to death by [the testimony of] fathers. Every man for his own sin shall be put to death [(But a child, one who is not yet "a man," (sometimes) dies by the hands of Heaven for his father's sin.)]
24:17	You shall not pervert the judgment of a stranger and an orphan [One who does so transgresses two negative commandments, this and 16:19 (the interdict being repeated here in that it is "easier" to pervert the judgment of the poor)], and you shall not take as a pledge [(not at the time of the loan)] the garment of a widow.
24:18	And you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and the L rd your G d redeemed you from there [to observe His statutes (even if doing so involves monetary loss)]; therefore, I command you to do this thing.
24:19	When you reap your harvest in your field, if you forget a sheaf, [but not a stack (a relatively large amount — whence it is derived that a sheaf containing two sa'ah is not considered shikchah ("forgetting")], in the field [including standing grain, part of which he forgot to cut], do not return to take it [(What is behind him is considered shikchah; what is before him, not.)] To the stranger, to the orphan, and to the widow shall it be, so that the L rd your G d will bless you in all the work of your hands, [though the shikchah comes to them without specific intent. How much more so will He bless you where there is specific intent!]
24:20	When you beat your olive tree, you shall not cut off [its fruit (whence it is derived that peah is left from a tree)] after you. [This alludes to shikchah.] To the stranger, to the orphan, and to the widow shall it be.
24:21	When you cut your vineyard, do not glean it after you [i.e., Do not take the tender grapes, those which have neither "arm" nor "dripping."] To the stranger, to the orphan, and to the widow shall it be.
24:22	And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt. Therefore, I command you to do this thing.
25
25:1	If there be a quarrel among men, and they draw near to judgment, [as, in the end, they will be constrained to do, peace not resulting from a quarrel], and they judge them, and they vindicate the righteous one, and they incriminate the wicked one,
25:2	Then it shall be, if the wicked one is liable to stripes [(as he is when he is in violation of a negative commandment which is unlinked to a (remedial) positive commandment, (like 4)], that the judge shall bend him down [(he receives stripes neither standing nor sitting, but bent over)] and he shall smite him on his front according to his (one) wickedness [i.e., one third of thirty-nine (and, on his back, two thirds)] in number (leading to)
25:3	forty [i.e., thirty-nine] shall he smite him, and not more [(an exhortation against striking one's neighbor)]; lest he smite him more than these, a great blow, and your brother be demeaned before your eyes. [All the day he is called "wicked"; once he has been smitten, he is called "your brother."]
25:4	You shall not muzzle an ox [or any other beast, animal, or bird being worked where food obtains. (A man is not included in the interdict against muzzling)] in its threshing [(All like "threshing" is included, thus excluding foods which do not grow from the ground, etc.)]
25:5	When brothers dwell together [i.e., when they had dwelt concurrently in the world (This excludes from yibum (levirate marriage) the wife of one's brother who had never been "in his world"). They must also be "together" vis-à-vis inheritance (This excludes from yibum the wife of one's maternal brother)], and one of them dies, and he has no son [or daughter, or son of a son or daughter of a son, or son of a daughter or daughter of a daughter], then the wife of the dead one shall not be outside to a strange man. Her levir (her husband's brother) shall come upon her and take her for himself as a wife, and he shall have her in levirate marriage.
25:6	And it shall be, the first-born [i.e., the eldest of the brothers] (in an instance) where she can bear [(a woman who cannot bear is excluded from yibum)], he shall be invested in the name of his dead brother [with the latter's inheritance in his father's property], and his name shall not be wiped out of Israel. [(This excludes from yibum the wife of a saris (one who is impotent), whose name is already "wiped out.")
25:7	And if the man does not desire to take his yevamah, then his yevamah shall go up to the gate [of beth-din] to the elders, and she shall say: My yavam does not desire to invest for his brother a name in Israel; he does not desire to have me in yibum.
25:8	Then the elders of his city shall call to him and they shall speak to him; and he shall stand up and say [in the holy tongue]: I did not desire to take her.
25:9	Then his yevamah shall draw near to him before the eyes of the elders, and she shall remove his shoe from his foot, and she shall spit before his face [on the ground], and she shall answer and say [in the holy tongue]: Thus shall it be done with the man who will not build [(he may not perform yibum at a later date)] the house of his brother.
25:10	And his name shall be called in Israel: "the house (of him) chalutz hana'al" ("whose shoe was removed"). [It is a mitzvah for all who are standing there to say: "chalutz hana'al."]
25:11	If men strive together, a man and his brother, and the wife of one draw near to rescue her husband from his assailant [(They are bound to come to blows — peace does not result from strife)], and she send forth her hand and seize his privy parts,
25:12	Then you shall "cut off her hand" [(monetary compensation (relative to the one shaming and the one shamed)]; you shall not have pity.
25:13	You shall not have [(If you have false weights, "you shall not have" anything!)] in your bag a stone and a stone [i.e., weights], a large and a small, [the large "contradicting" the small (buying with the large and selling with the small)].
25:14	You shall not have in your house a measure and a measure, large and small.
25:15	[If you have] a whole and just stone, you shall have [much]; a whole and just measure, you shall have, so that your days be prolonged on the land that the L rd your G d gives to you.
25:16	For the abomination of the L rd your G d are all who do these, all who do wrong.
25:17	Remember what Amalek did to you on the way when you went out of Egypt [(If you falsify weights and measures, apprehend the onset of the foe.)]
25:18	Who chanced upon you on the way and cut off [the membrums] from you [and cast them heavenwards], (of) all who were faint [from sin] behind you, [the clouds of glory having rejected them], and you were faint [from thirst] and weary [with traveling], and he [Amalek] did not fear G d [to desist from attacking you].
25:19	And it shall be, when the L rd your G d gives you repose from all your enemies roundabout in the land that the L rd your G d gives to you as an inheritance to inherit it, that you shall wipe out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens, [(so that not even a beast remain of them of which it might be said: "This belonged to Amalek.")] You shall not forget.

26
26:1	And it shall be, when you come to the land that the L rd your G d gives to you as an inheritance, and you inherit it and dwell in it [(The mitzvah of bikkurim did not obtain until they had conquered and apportioned the land)],
26:2	Then you shall take of the first [(tying a band around the first fruit to ripen and designating it as bikkurim)] of all the fruits of the earth [the seven distinctive species of Eretz Yisrael] that you bring from your land that the L rd your G d gives unto you, and you shall put them in a basket and go to the place wherein the L rd your G d chooses to repose His name.
26:3	And you shall come to the Cohein who shall be in those days [(whoever he may be)], and you shall say to him [(that you are not remiss in gratitude)]: I have professed this day [(Bikkurim are offered once a year, not twice)] to the L rd your G d that I have come to the land which the L rd swore to our forefathers to give us.
26:4	And the Cohein shall take the basket from your hand [to wave it (The Cohein places his hand under that of the owner and waves it)], and he shall place it before the altar of the L rd your G d.
26:5	And you shall lift your voice and say before the L rd your G d: An Aramean [Lavan] destroyed my father [(Lavan intended to root out the entire nation in pursuing Jacob, and the evil intent of the gentiles is accounted as the act)], and, [after Lavan, others sought to destroy us; for after this] he went down to Egypt. And he lived there in scant number, [seventy souls], and he became there a great, mighty, and populous nation.
26:6	And Egypt wrought evil unto us, and they afflicted us, and they placed us under hard labor.
26:7	And we cried out to the L rd, the G d of our fathers. And the L rd heard our voices, and He saw our affliction, our toil, and our oppression.
26:8	And the L rd took us out of Egypt with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great fear, and with signs and with wonders.
26:9	And He brought us to this place [the Temple], and He gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.
26:10	And now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the land, which You, O L rd, have given to me. Then you shall place it before the L rd your G d, [(the bearer having taken it after the Cohein's waving and having held it in his hand during his declaration, after which it was again waved)], and you shall bow down before the L rd your G d.
26:11	And you shall rejoice in all the good that the L rd your G d has given you and your household [(The bikkurim declaration is recited only in a time of rejoicing — from Shavuoth until Succoth — when one gathers his grain, his fruits, his wine and his oil. From Succoth on, he brings the bikkurim but does not recite the declaration)], you and the Levite [(from what was planted in their cities)], and the stranger in your midst. [He brings bikkurim, but does not recite the declaration, ("to our forefathers" (3), not applying in this instance.)]
26:12	When you finish tithing [(by Pesach of the fourth year)] all the tithe of your produce of the third year, the year of the tithe [i.e., when there obtains only one tithe (ma'aser rishon) of the two tithes (ma'aser rishon and ma'aser sheni) of the two preceding years, (ma'aser ani replacing ma'aser sheni in the third year)], and you have given [ma'aser rishon] to the Levite, and [ma'aser ani ("the poor tithe")] to the stranger, the orphan, and the widow, that they shall eat in your gates and be sated [(Give them enough for "satiety")],
26:13	Then you shall say before the L rd your G d [(Declare that you have given your tithes)]: I have removed the holy thing [ma'aser sheni and neta revai (see Leviticus 27:30 and 19:24)] from the house [If he delayed bringing his tithes of the first two years to Jerusalem, he must do so now], and I have also [(Terumah and bikkurim are hereby included)] given it [ma'aser rishon] to the Levite, and [ma'aser ani] to the stranger, the orphan, and the widow, according to all of Your mitzvah that You commanded me [(I gave all of the tithes in their proper order)]. I did not depart from Your mitzvoth [(I did not tithe from one species for another or from the new for the old)], and I did not forget [to bless You at the tithing].
26:14	I did not eat in my mourning of it, [it being forbidden to a mourner], and I did not remove of it in uncleanliness, [whether I were unclean, and it (the tithe) clean; or, I, clean, and it, unclean], and I did not give of it for the dead [for the making of casket and shrouds]. I have hearkened to the voice of the L rd my G d [(I have brought it to the Temple)]. I have done according to all that You commanded me [(I rejoiced, and I rejoiced others therewith)].
26:15	Look down from Your holy abode, from the heavens, and bless Your people, Israel, and the land which You have given us [We have done (with respect to the tithes) what You decreed upon us — You do what You have promised us (viz. Leviticus 26:3-4)] — just as You swore unto our fathers a land flowing with milk and honey [and You fulfilled what You promised them].
26:16	This day the L rd your G d commands you to do these statutes and the judgments [(Let them always be new in your eyes, as if He is commanding you "this day.")] [A heavenly voice blesses the bringer of bikkurim, viz.]: And [as you have brought bikkurim this day], may you [merit to] keep and do them [the following year] with all your heart and with all your soul.
26:17	The L rd did single you out this day to be to you as a G d, and to walk in His ways, and to keep His statutes, and His mitzvoth, and His judgments, and to heed His voice.
26:18	And the L rd did single you out this day to be to Him as a chosen people, as He spoke to you [Exodus 19:5], and to keep all of His mitzvoth.
26:19	And to exalt you above all of the nations that He made — for praise, name, and glory — and so that you be a holy people to the L rd your G d, as He spoke [Exodus 20:26].
27
27:1	And Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying: Keep [always] the entire mitzvah that I command you this day.
27:2	And it shall be, on the day that you cross the Jordan to the land that the L rd your G d gives you, that you shall set up [in the Jordan] great stones, and you shall paint them with lime.
27:3	And you shall write upon them all the words of this Torah when you pass over, so that you come to the land that the L rd your G d gives to you, a land flowing with milk and honey, as the L rd, the G d of your fathers, spoke to you.
27:4	And it shall be, when you cross the Jordan, that you shall set up these stones which I command you this day in Mount Eival, and you shall paint them with lime.
27:5	And you shall build there an altar to the L rd your G d, an altar of stones. You shall not lift iron over them.
27:6	Of whole stones shall you build the altar of the L rd your G d, and you shall offer upon it burnt-offerings to the L rd your G d.
27:7	And you shall sacrifice peace-offerings and you shall eat there, and you shall rejoice before the L rd your G d.
27:8	And you shall write on the stones all the words of this Torah, well explained [in seventy languages].
27:9	And Moses and the Cohanim, the Levites, spoke to all of Israel, saying: Listen and hear, O Israel: This day you have become a people to the L rd your G d [(Let it be in your eyes as if you have entered into the covenant with Him this day.)]
27:10	And you shall heed the voice of the L rd your G d, and you shall do His mitzvoth and His statutes which I command you this day.
27:11	And Moses commanded the people on that day, saying:
27:12	These shall stand for the blessing of the people on Mount Gerizim when you cross over the Jordan: Shimon, Levi, Yehudah, Yissachar, Yosef, and Binyamin [Six tribes went up to the top of Mount Gerizim and six to the top of Mount Eival, the Cohanim and the Levites standing with the ark, below, in the middle. The Levites turned their faces towards Mount Gerizim and opened with blessing, viz.: "Blessed is the man who does not make a graven image or a molten image," and all (on both mountains) answered Amen. Then they turned to Mount Eival and recited the corresponding curse, viz. (15): "Cursed is the man who makes a graven or a molten image, etc.", and so with all, until (26): "Cursed is he who does not fulfill, etc." (see 11:29)]
27:13	And these shall stand for the curse on Mount Eival: Reuven, Gad, and Asher, and Zevulun, Dan, and Naftali.
27:14	And the Levites shall lift their voices, and they shall say to all the men of Israel in a loud voice:
27:15	Cursed is the man who makes a graven or a molten image, the abomination of the L rd, the work of the hands of an artisan, and places it in secret. And all the people shall answer and say: Amen.
27:16	Cursed is he who demeans his father and his mother. And all the people shall say: Amen.
27:17	Cursed is he who moves back the boundary marker of his neighbor, [thus stealing his land]. And all the people shall say: Amen.
27:18	Cursed is he who misleads the blind man on the way [i.e., one who gives the unknowing bad advice]. And all the people shall say: Amen.
27:19	Cursed is he who perverts the judgment of the stranger, the orphan, and the widow. And all the people shall say: Amen.
27:20	Cursed is he who lies with his father's wife, for he has uncovered his father's lap. And all the people shall say: Amen.
27:21	Cursed is he who lies with any beast. And all the people shall say: Amen.
27:22	Cursed is he who lies with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say: Amen.
27:23	Cursed is he who lies with his mother-in-law. And all the people shall say: Amen.
27:24	Cursed is he who smites his neighbor [i.e., who slanders him] in secret. And all the people shall say: Amen.
27:25	Cursed is he who takes graft to smite a soul of innocent blood. And all the people shall say: Amen.
27:26	Cursed is he who does not fulfill the words of this Torah to do them. And all the people shall say: Amen. [The entire Torah is herein included, and they accepted it under imprecation and oath.]
28
28:1	And it shall be, if you heed the voice of the L rd your G d to observe to do all of His mitzvoth that I command you today, then the L rd your G d shall exalt you above all the nations of the earth.
28:2	And there shall come upon you all of these blessings and they shall cleave unto you, if you heed the voice of the L rd your G d.
28:3	Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be in the field.
28:4	Blessed shall be the fruit of your womb, the fruit of your land, and the fruit of your beasts, the offspring of your cattle, and the flocks of your sheep.
28:5	Blessed shall be your fruits and your remainder [i.e., what is dry and does not ooze out of the vessel].
28:6	Blessed shall you be in your coming in and blessed shall you be in your going out [You will leave the world without sin, as when you entered it.]
28:7	The L rd shall render your foes, who rise up against you, smitten before you. By one way shall they go forth against you, and by seven ways [in the manner of the panic-stricken] shall they flee before you.
28:8	The L rd shall command unto you the blessing in your store-houses and in all to which you put your hand, and He shall bless you in the land that the L rd your G d gives to you.
28:9	The L rd shall raise you as a holy people unto Him, as He swore to you, if you heed the mitzvoth of the L rd your G d and you walk in His ways.
28:10	And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the L rd is called upon you, and they shall fear you.
28:11	And the L rd shall cause you to remain for the good — in the fruit of your womb, and the fruit of your beasts, and the fruit of your land — on the land that the L rd swore to your fathers to give to you.
28:12	The L rd shall open for you His goodly treasure trove, the heavens, to give to you the rain of your land in its time and to bless all to which you put your hand, and you shall lend many nations, and you shall not borrow.
28:13	And the L rd shall make you a head and not a tail. And you will be only above, and you will not be below — if you heed the mitzvoth of the L rd your G d that I command you this day, to keep and to do.
28:14	And you shall not deviate from all of the things that I command you this day, right and left, to go after other gods to serve them.
28:15	And it shall be, if you do not heed the voice of the L rd your G d to observe to do all of His mitzvoth and His statutes that I command you this day, then there shall come upon you all of these curses and they will cleave unto you.
28:16	Cursed will you be in the city and cursed will you be in the field.
28:17	Cursed will be your fruits and your remainder.
28:18	Cursed will be the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your land, the offspring of your cattle and the flocks of your sheep.
28:19	Cursed will you be in your coming in and cursed will you be in your going out.
28:20	The L rd will send in you the blight, the mehumah [a terrifying sound], and the blast, in all to which you put your hand, until He destroys you, and until you go lost quickly because of the evil of your deeds in having left Me.
28:21	The L rd shall cause to cleave to you the pestilence, until it consumes you from off the land whither you come to inherit it.
28:22	The L rd will smite you with shachefeth [swelling and blowing up of the flesh], and with kadachath [a fever], and with daleketh [hotter than kadachath], and with charchur [internal fever and constant thirst], and with the sword, and with [field blights]: shidafon [the east wind] and yerakon [dryness (the grain turning pale)], and they shall pursue you until you go lost.
28:23	And your skies over your head shall be as brass, and your earth under you, as iron [as opposed to (Leviticus 26:19): "And I shall make your skies as iron and your earth as brass," these being stated by the L rd Himself, and being more severe, in that iron does not "sweat" (implying that the skies will provide no moisture whatsoever) and brass does "sweat" implying that the fruit will rot), whereas the curses here are stated by Moses, who attenuated them.]
28:24	The L rd will render the rain of your land dust and sand [through a wind following the rain, which will blow the dust onto the wet plants, creating a sticky layer which shall desiccate and rot them]. From heaven shall it descend upon you until it destroys you.
28:25	The L rd will render you smitten before your foes. By one way shall you go forth against him, and by seven ways shall you flee before him, and you will become a(n) [emblem of] horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
28:26	And your carcass shall be food for all the birds of heaven and the beasts of the earth, with none to frighten (them off).
28:27	The L rd will smite you with the boils of Egypt [(a pernicious variety) moist on the outside and dry on the inside], and with swellings, and garav [moist boils], and charess [boils dry as shard], of which you will not be able to be healed.
28:28	The L rd will smite you with madness and blindness and closure of heart.
28:29	And you shall grope in mid-day, as the blind man gropes in pitch darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways; and you shall be but thwarted and despoiled all of your days with no one to save (you).
28:30	A wife shall you betroth, but a different man shall possess her. A house shall you build, but you shall not dwell therein. A vineyard shall you plant, but you shall not redeem it [in the fourth year to eat its fruits].
28:31	Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will not eat thereof. Your ass will be stolen before you and will not return to you. Your flock will be given to your foes with none to save them for you.
28:32	Your sons and your daughters will be given to a different people, and your eyes will see and fail for them [to return] the entire day, but you shall remain powerless.
28:33	The fruit of your ground and all of your toil will be eaten by a people that you know not, and you will be but thwarted and broken all of the days.
28:34	And you will be maddened by the sight of your eyes that you see.
28:35	The L rd will smite you with sore boils on the knees and on the thighs, which you will not be able to heal, from the sole of your foot until your crown.
28:36	The L rd will lead you and your king that you set over you to a nation that you have not known, neither you nor your fathers. And you will serve there other gods, wood and stone.
28:37	And you will be [a source of] astonishment, parable, and simile [("This is exactly like what happened to…!")], and [a subject of] converse in all of the peoples whither the L rd leads you.
28:38	Much seed shall you take out to the field, but little shall you gather in, for the locust will consume it.
28:39	Vineyards will you plant and work, but wine will you not drink or store, for the worm shall consume it.
28:40	Olive trees will you have in all of your borders, but with oil shall you not anoint yourself, for your olive tree will cast off [its fruits].
28:41	Sons and daughters will you beget, but they shall not be yours, for they will go into captivity.
28:42	All of your trees and the fruit of your land will be impoverished by the locust.
28:43	The stranger in your midst will rise ever higher above you, and you will descend lower and lower.
28:44	He will lend to you, and you will not lend to him. He will be the head, and you will be the tail.
28:45	And all of these curses will come upon you, and pursue you, and cleave unto you, until you are destroyed, (this) for not having heeded the voice of the L rd your G d, to keep His mitzvoth and His statutes that He commanded you.
28:46	And they will be in you for a sign and a wonder and in your seed forever.
28:47	Because you did not serve the L rd your G d with joy and with goodness of heart when you had an abundance of all.
28:48	And you shall serve your foes whom the L rd shall send against you, in hunger and thirst, in nakedness and in want of all; and He shall place a yoke of iron upon your neck until He destroys you.
28:49	The L rd shall raise up against you a nation from afar, from the end of the earth, as the eagle soars, [with suddenness and swiftness], a nation whose tongue you will not know.
28:50	A nation of brazen mien, who will not defer to the old and will not spare the young.
28:51	And he will eat the fruits of your beasts and the fruit of your ground, until you are destroyed, (a nation) that will not leave over for you corn, wine, or oil, the offspring of your cattle or the flocks of your sheep, until he has destroyed you.
28:52	And he will oppress you in all of your gates until the conquest of your high and fortified walls in which you trust in all your land. And he will oppress you in all of your gates in all your land which the L rd your G d gives to you.
28:53	And you will eat the fruit of your womb, the flesh of your sons and your daughters that the L rd your G d has given you, because of the siege and the [consequent] extremity [of famine] wherewith your foe will oppress you.
28:54	The man of extreme delicacy among you [who would normally recoil from anything offensive] — his eye will be grudging to his brother and the wife of his bosom and the rest of his sons whom he shall leave,
28:55	Not to give to one of them of the flesh of his sons that he will eat, nothing being left to him in the siege and in the extremity wherewith your foe will oppress you in all of your gates.
28:56	The woman of extreme delicacy among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground in the exquisiteness of her delicacy — her eye shall be grudging to the husband of her bosom, and to her [older] son and daughter,
28:57	And to her young who issue from between her legs, and to her children whom she will beget; for she will eat them in want of all, in secret, [and she will not share them with her remaining children], in the siege and in the extremity wherewith your foes will oppress you in your gates.
28:58	If you do not observe to do all the words of this Torah that are written in this scroll to fear this honored, awesome Name, the L rd your G d.
28:59	Then the L rd will make distinctive [from all other plagues] your plagues, and the plagues of your seed, plagues great and trusted ["to fulfill their embassy"], and sore, trusty illnesses.
28:60	And the L rd will send against you all the afflictions [i.e., the plagues] of Egypt, which you feared [would come upon you], and they will cleave to you.
28:61	Also, every sickness and every plague which is not written in the scroll of this Torah, the L rd will bring them up against you until you are destroyed.
28:62	And you will remain but few in number instead of being like the stars of heaven in multitude, for not having heeded the voice of the L rd your G d.
28:63	And it shall be that just as the L rd rejoiced over you to do good to you and to increase you, so will the L rd rejoice [others] over you to destroy you and to annihilate you, and you will be uprooted from the land whither you are coming to inherit it.
28:64	And the L rd will scatter you among all the peoples, from one end of the earth until the other, and you will serve there [(by paying tribute and poll-tax to the priests of idolatry)] other gods, that you did not know, you and your fathers, wood and stone.
28:65	And among those nations you shall not find ease, and there shall be no rest for the sole of your foot; and the L rd shall give you there a quaking heart, and failing of eyes [aspiring to the salvation that does not come], and despair of soul.
28:66	And your life shall be hanging [in doubt] before you [in your constant apprehension of death], and you will fear night and day, and you will not believe in your life.
28:67	In the morning you will say: Would that it were evening [of the preceding day], and in the evening you will say: Would that it were [the preceding] morning [(your suffering increasing progressively)], from the fear of your heart that you shall fear, and from the sight of your eyes that you shall see.
28:68	And the L rd will return you to Egypt in boats [in captivity] by the way, of which I said to you: You shall not venture to see it again; and you shall [desire to] be sold there to your foes [as bondsmen and bondswomen] — but there shall be no buyer, [for death and destruction shall be decreed upon you.]
28:69	These are the words of the covenant that the L rd commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel, [that they take the Torah upon themselves under imprecation and oath] in the land of Moav, aside from the covenant which He made with them in Chorev [i.e., aside from the curses in Leviticus stated at Sinai.]
29
29:1	And Moses called to all of Israel and he said to them: You saw all that the L rd did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land.
29:2	The great trials which your eyes witnessed, the signs, and those great wonders [see 4:34].
29:3	And the L rd did not give you a heart to know [the lovingkindness of the L rd and to cleave to Him], and eyes to see and ears to hear until this day. [On the day the L rd gave the Torah scroll to the sons of Levi (31:9), the other tribes remonstrated at its not having been given to them, too. Moses was gratified at this and said (27:9): "This day you have become a people to the L rd, etc."]
29:4	And I led you forty years in the desert. Your clothes have not worn from off you, and your shoes have not worn from off your feet.
29:5	Bread you have not eaten, and wine and strong drink you have not drunk, so that you should know that I am the L rd your G d.
29:6	And you have come to this place [(Now you see yourselves in greatness and glory. Do not "kick" against the L rd, and let your hearts not give way to pride, (8): "And you shall heed, etc.")], and Sichon the king of Cheshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out against us in war and we smote them.
29:7	And we took their land, and we gave it as an inheritance to the Reuveni and to the Gadi and to the half tribe of Menasheh.
29:8	And you shall heed the words of this covenant, and you shall do them, so that you may prosper in all that you do.
Nitzavim
29:9	You are standing this day, all of you, before the L rd your G d [(Moses assembled them before the Holy One Blessed be He on the day of his death to bring them into the covenant)], your heads of your tribes, your elders and your officers, [in order of prominence, followed by] all the men of Israel.
29:10	Your little ones, your wives, and your stranger that is in the midst of your camp, from the hewer of your wood to the drawer of your water [(These were Canaanites who came by stratagem to convert in the days of Moses, as the Giveonites did in the days of Joshua (see Joshua 9:4)].
29:11	So that you pass into the covenant [(The makers of a covenant would make a partition on both sides, through which they would pass)] of the L rd your G d and into His oath, which the L rd your G d makes with you this day.
29:12	[He is doing all this] in order to confirm you this day unto Him as a people, and Himself to you as a G d, as He spoke to you and as He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob [not to exchange you for another nation, for which reason He binds you with these oaths, so that you not provoke Him.]
29:13	And not with you alone do I contract this covenant and this oath,
29:14	But with whoever is present here with us standing this day before the L rd our G d and with whoever is not here with us this day, [even the future generations].
29:15	For you have known our dwelling in the land of Egypt and our passing in the midst of the nations wherein you passed [and which some of you might be tempted to join],
29:16	And you saw their abominations and their offal, [idols of] wood and stone [which were open to view], and [idols of] silver and gold which [they kept] with them [in secret, fearing that they would be stolen],
29:17	Lest there be among you a man or a woman, a family or a tribe, whose heart turns this day from the L rd our G d to go and serve the gods of those nations — Lest there be among you a root sprouting gall and wormwood [i.e., generating evil in your midst],
29:18	And it be, when he hears the words of this curse that he bless himself in his heart, saying: [These curses will not come upon me, but] "All will be well with me, for as my heart sees fit shall I do," so that the unwitting (sin) is added (for punishment) to the willful,
29:19	The L rd will not wish to forgive him, for then the wrath of the L rd and His vengeance will burn against that man, and there shall descend upon him the entire curse that is written in this scroll, and the L rd will erase his name from under the heavens.
29:20	And the L rd will set him aside for evil from all of the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this scroll of the Torah.
29:21	And the latter generation will say, your children who arise after you, and the stranger who comes from a far-off land, and who see the plagues of that land and the ills which the L rd has inflicted upon it,
29:22	Brimstone and salt, a conflagration of the entire land — not being sown, and not sprouting, and not bringing forth any herb — like the overthrow of Sodom and Amorah, Admah and Tzvoyim, which the L rd overturned in His wrath and His fury.
29:23	And all the nations will say: Why did the L rd do thus to this land? What means the burning of this great wrath?
29:24	Then they will say: It is because they forsook the covenant of the L rd, the G d of their fathers, that He made with them when He brought them forth from the land of Egypt.
29:25	And they went and they served other gods and they bowed down to them, gods whom they did not know [to be potent] and whom He did not confer upon them.
29:26	And the wrath of the L rd burned against that land to bring upon it the entire curse written in this scroll.
29:27	And the L rd drove them off from their land in wrath and fury and great rage, and He cast them into a different land as this day.
29:28	[And if you ask: What can we do if we are punished for the hidden thoughts of one man" (see 17) — know that] the hidden things [of the individual] are for the L rd our G d [to punish], but the revealed ones are for us and our children [(who become subject to the oath after crossing the Jordan) to extirpate from our midst] forever, to do according to all the words of this Torah, [failing which, we are subject to punishment.]
30
30:1	And it shall be, when there are come upon you all of these things, the blessing and the curse that I have placed before you, and you return unto your hearts among all the nations whereunto the L rd your G d has driven you,
30:2	And you return to the L rd your G d and you heed His voice according to all that I command you this day, you and your children, with all your heart and with all your soul,
30:3	Then the L rd your G d will return with your captivity, [the Shechinah, as it were, having shared with Israel the suffering of the exile], and He shall have mercy upon you, and He shall return and gather you from all the peoples whereunto the L rd your G d has dispersed you.
30:4	If your cast-off ones be in the end of the heavens, from there the L rd your G d will gather you and from there He will take you.
30:5	And the L rd your G d will bring you to the land which your forefathers inherited, and you will inherit it. And He shall do good unto you, and He shall increase you even more than your fathers.
30:6	And the L rd your G d will circumcise your heart and the heart of your seed to love the L rd your G d with all your heart and with all your soul, so that you live.
30:7	And the L rd your G d will place all these curses on your foes and on your haters, who pursued you.
30:8	And you will return and you will hearken to the voice of the L rd, and you will do all of His mitzvoth that I command you this day.
30:9	And the L rd your G d will increase you in all the work of your hands, in the fruit of your womb, and in the fruit of your beasts, and in the fruit of your land for the good. For the L rd will return to rejoice over you for the good as He rejoiced over your fathers.
30:10	If you heed the voice of the L rd your G d to keep His mitzvoth and His statutes which are written in this Torah scroll, if you return to the L rd your G d with all your heart and with all your soul.
30:11	For this mitzvah which I command you this day is not concealed from you and it is not far off.
30:12	It is not in the heavens [(If it were, you would have to go up after it to study it)], that one would say: Who will go up for us to heaven and take it for us and make us hear it that we might do it?
30:13	And it is not across the seas, that one would say: Who will cross the seas for us and take it for us and make us hear it that we might do it?
30:14	For the thing is very near to you [(the Torah having been given in writing and by word of mouth)], in your mouth and in your heart to do it.
30:15	See, I have set before you this day, the life and the good [(The first is contingent upon the second)], and the death and the evil, [viz.:]
30:16	What I command you this day, to love the L rd your G d, to walk in His ways, and to keep His mitzvoth, and His statutes, and His judgments [(This is "the good")], and you will live, and you will multiply [(This is "the life")], and the L rd your G d will bless you in the land whither you come to inherit it.
30:17	And if your heart turns, and you do not hearken, and you are drawn away, and you bow down to other gods and you serve them [(This is "the evil")],
30:18	I tell you this day that you will go lost [(This is "the death")]; you will not prolong days on the land whither you cross over the Jordan to come there to inherit it.
30:19	I call as witness upon you this day heaven and earth [(They endure forever, and if evil befall you, they will testify that I forewarned you of all this.)] The life and the death have I set before you, the blessing and the curse, and [I urge you to] choose the life, so that you live, you and your seed.
30:20	To love the L rd your G d, to heed His voice, and to cleave to Him. For He is your life and the length of your days to dwell on the land that the L rd swore to your forefathers — to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob — to give to them.
Vayelech
31
31:1	And Moses went and he spoke these words to all of Israel.
31:2	And he said to them: I am one hundred and twenty years old this day [(On this day I was born, and on this day I shall die)]. I shall no longer be able to go out and to come in, [(the warrant to do so having been taken from him and accorded Joshua)], for the L rd has said to me: You shall not cross over this Jordan.
31:3	The L rd your G d — He crosses over before you. He will destroy these nations before you and you will inherit them. Joshua — he crosses over before you, as the L rd has spoken.
31:4	And the L rd shall do to them as He did to Sichon and to Og, the kings of the Emori and to their land, having destroyed them.
31:5	And the L rd will deliver them before you, and you shall do to them according to all of the mitzvah that I have commanded you.
31:6	Be strong and firm. Do not fear and do not break before them. For the L rd your G d — It is He that goes before you; He will not let go of you, and He will not forsake you.
31:7	And Moses called to Joshua and he said to him before the eyes of all of Israel: Be strong and firm, for you will come with this people [(The elders of the generation shall be with you — all will be according to their judgment and counsel)] to the land that the L rd swore to their fathers to give to them, and you shall cause them to inherit it.
31:8	And the L rd — It is He who goes before you. He will be with you; He will not let go of you and He will not forsake you. Do not fear and do not break.
31:9	And Moses wrote this Torah, and [when he finished writing all of it], he gave it to [his tribe], the Cohanim, the sons of Levi, who carry the ark of the covenant of the L rd, and to all the elders of Israel.
31:10	And Moses commanded them, saying: At the end of seven years [in the first year of (the new) shemitah (period), i.e., in the eighth year)], at the time of the year of the shemitah, [(the laws of shemitah still obtaining for the produce of the seventh year harvested in the eighth)], in the festival of Succoth,
31:11	When all of Israel come to appear before the L rd your G d in the place that He shall choose, you shall read this Torah before all of Israel, in their ears [(The king would read from the beginning of Deuteronomy on a wooden platform that they set up in the azarah.)]
31:12	Assemble the people: the men [to learn], the women [to hear], and the little ones, [to confer reward on those who bring them], and the stranger in your gates, so that they hear and so that they learn and fear the L rd your G d and observe to do all the words of this Torah.
31:13	And their sons who did not know shall hear and learn to fear the L rd your G d all of the days that you live upon the land whither you cross the Jordan to inherit it.
31:14	And the L rd said to Moses: Behold, your days have drawn near to die. Call Joshua and stand in the tent of meeting and I will charge him. And Moses and Joshua went and they stood in the tent of meeting.
31:15	And the L rd appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the tent.
31:16	And the L rd said to Moses: Behold, you shall lie down with your fathers, and this people shall arise and stray after the gods of the nations of the land into whose midst it is coming; and it will forsake Me and break the covenant that I made with it.
31:17	And My wrath shall burn against them on that day, and I shall forsake them, and I shall hide My face from them [as if I do not see their suffering], and they shall be prey, and many ills and afflictions shall befall them. And it (Israel) shall say on that day: Is it not because my G d is not in my midst that these ills have befallen me?
31:18	And I shall utterly hide My face on that day because of all the evil that it did, because it turned to other gods.
31:19	And now, write for yourselves this song [32:1-43] and teach it to the children of Israel. Place it in their mouths, so that this song be a witness for Me with the children of Israel.
31:20	For I shall bring them to the land that I have sworn to their fathers, flowing milk and honey, and they shall eat and be sated and grow fat, and they shall turn to other gods and serve them, and they shall spurn Me and break My covenant.
31:21	And it shall be, when many ills and afflictions befall them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness [that I forewarned them in it (the song) of all that would befall them], for it will not be forgotten from the mouth of their seed [(an assurance to Israel that the Torah will never be entirely forgotten by their seed)]. For I have known its inclination, what it does today, before I bring it to the land that I have sworn.
31:22	And Moses wrote this song on that day, and he taught it to the children of Israel.
31:23	And He charged Joshua the son of Nun, saying: Be strong and firm, for you will bring the children of Israel to the land that I swore to them, and I shall be with you.
31:24	And it was, when Moses had finished writing the words of this Torah on a scroll until their end,
31:25	That Moses commanded the Levites, the bearers of the ark of the covenant of the L rd, saying:
31:26	Take the scroll of this Torah and place it at the side of the ark of the covenant of the L rd your G d [(according to one view, on a board projecting outside the ark; according to another, alongside the tablets within the ark)], and it shall be there for witness in you.
31:27	For I have known your rebellion and your stiff neck. If until the time I have been living with you this day, you have been rebellious against the L rd, how much more so after my death!
31:28	Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes and your officers and I will speak in their ears these words, and I will call upon heaven and earth to be witness in them [(In 30:19, he spoke to Israel; now he will speak to heaven and earth.)]
31:29	For I know that after my death [i.e., after the death of Joshua, whom Moses considered like himself] you will corrupt yourselves and you will turn from the way that I commanded unto you, and the evil will befall you in the end of days, for you will do the evil in the eyes of the L rd to anger Him with the deeds of your hands.
31:30	And Moses spoke in the ears of the entire assembly of Israel the words of this song until their end:
Ha'azinu
32
32:1	Listen, O heavens, and I shall speak, and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth [wherewith I am forewarning Israel, and be witnesses to the fact that I told them you would be my witnesses (see 30:19). (If they are meritorious, the heavens and the earth will give them their bounty; if not, they will withhold it.)]
32:2	[This is what you shall testify, that I say before you that the Torah that I gave to Israel is life to the world, just as rain is.] My teaching [i.e., Torah] shall drip as the rain; My word shall flow as the dew, [which is universally welcome], as winds upon the herbage, [which cause it to flourish (so Torah causes its disciples to flourish)], as showers upon the [(individual) blades] of grass.
32:3	When I call the name of the L rd, ascribe greatness to our G d [(whence it is derived that after a blessing in the Temple, the response is "Blessed is the name of the glory of His kingdom" (Baruch shem kevod malchutho)].
32:4	The Rock [Even when He is strong (as a rock), when He brings punishment upon the flouters of His will] — perfect, [in absolute accord with justice] is His work, for all of His ways are judgment [and not blind fury]. He is a G d of trust [to repay the righteous in the world to come], without wrong [even to the wicked. He repays their deeds of righteousness in this world.] He is [pronounced] righteous [i.e., All vindicate His judgment], and it is fit [that they do so].
32:5	They have corrupted [themselves], not Him. [They were] His sons, [and the corruption that they wrought is] their blemish [and not His] — a crooked and twisted generation!
32:6	Would you thus requite the L rd, [who has the power to exact punishment of you, and who accorded you all manner of good?] Ignorant people, [who forgot all that was done to them], and not wise [to foresee consequences, it being in His power to do good and ill]. Is He not your father, your provider? He made you [a nation among nations], and He established you [securely].
32:7	Remember the days of yore [i.e., what He did to the first ones who angered Him]; reflect upon the years of [the] generation [of Enosh, which He flooded with Oceanus], and [the] generation [of the flood]. Ask your father [the prophets], and he shall tell you; your elders [the sages], and they will relate it [the early happenings] to you.
32:8	When the Most High caused [the] nations [who angered Him] to "inherit," [He inundated them]; when He separated the sons of man [i.e., when He scattered the generation of the Tower of Babel (dor haflagah), He could have removed them from the world; but He did not do so. Instead,] He set the bounds [(seventy tongues)] of the peoples [He established them and did not cause them to go lost], for the sake of the number of the children of Israel [that were destined to go forth from the children of Shem, and in accordance with the number of seventy souls of the children of Israel who went down to Egypt.]
32:9	[And why all this?] For the portion of the L rd [was secreted among them and destined to come forth. And who is His "portion"?] — His people. [And who is His people?] Jacob, the cord of His inheritance, [the third cord of a three-fold cord (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), Jacob and his sons being His inheritance (not Ishmael, the son of Abraham, and not Esav, the son of Isaac.)]
32:10	He found them [(Jacob's sons) faithful unto Him] in a desert land, [Israel accepting His Torah, His kingdom, and His yoke, as opposed to Ishmael and Esav (see 33:2)], and in a wasteland, howling [with jackals, etc.] and desolate. [(Even there they were steadfast in their faith.)] [There] He surrounded them [with clouds, and with standards on four sides, and with the base of the mountain (Sinai), arching it over them like a barrel], He invested them [with Torah and understanding]. He protected them [from fiery serpents, scorpions, and the nations] like the pupil of His eye.
32:11	[He led them with mercy and compassion,] as an eagle [by soft motions] awakes its nest, hovering over its fledglings [and not bearing down upon them. (Likewise, the Holy One Blessed be He, in giving Israel the Torah, did not "bear down upon them" from one side, but "projected Himself" from four sides)], spreading its wings and taking them, bearing them on its pinion [from place to place, unlike other birds, who take their young in their talons, fearing the eagle who flies above them. Not so the eagle, which fears no other birds, but only projectiles, from which it shields its fledglings with its body.) The L rd, likewise, "shielded" Israel at the Red Sea (See Exodus 19:4 and 14: 19-20)]
32:12	The L rd led them [in the desert], alone [and secure], and there was no power [in any of the] strange [i.e., the nations' gods] against them.
32:13	He made him ride on the high places of the earth [(Eretz Yisrael is the highest of all the lands)], and he ate the shoots of the field [(The fruits of Eretz Yisrael "shoot up" faster than all others)]. And He gave him to suck [fig-] honey from the rock, and oil from the flint of the rock [(These are the olives of Gush Chalav.)]
32:14	Cream from the herd and milk from the flock [(as transpired in the days of Solomon (I Kings 5:2-3)], with fat of lambs [(as transpired in the days of the ten tribes (Amos 6:4)], and [fat] rams of the breed of Bashan, and he-goats, with wheat [as fat as] the fat of kidneys [(as transpired in the days of Solomon (I Kings 5:2)], and blood of the grape did you drink [as choice] wine [(as transpired in the days of the ten tribes (Amos 6:6)].
32:15	And Yeshurun grew fat and it kicked. You grew fat, you grew thick, you were covered [with fat], and he forsook the G d who made him and abased the Rock of his salvation [see Ezekiel 8:16].
32:16	They provoked Him with strange [gods]; they angered Him with abominations [like sodomy and necromancy].
32:17	They sacrificed to demons, which availed naught [(If there were some utility to them, His anger would not be "doubled" as it is now)], (to) gods they had not known, new ones, newly come, [who were unknown even to the heathens, (who thought them to be Jewish images)] — your fathers had not dreaded them.
32:18	The Rock of your birth you forgot; and you forgot the G d who brought you forth [from the womb].
32:19	And the L rd saw and He thrust away in anger His sons and His daughters.
32:20	And He said: I shall hide My face from them. I shall see what their end shall be. For they are a generation of conversion [They convert My favor to anger], sons in whom there is no rearing [i.e., in whom My rearing is not evident, I, having reared them to good, and they, having departed from it.]
32:21	They have incited Me with a no-god; they have angered Me with their vanities. And I will incite them with a no-people [i.e., a people of no repute (viz. Isaiah 23:13; Ovadiah 1:2)]. With a base nation [i.e., the heretics (viz. Psalms 14:1)] will I anger them.
32:22	For a fire has been kindled in My wrath, and it shall burn [in you] to the nethermost pit [the foundation], and it shall consume the land [i.e., your land] and its produce, and it shall set ablaze the foundations of the mountains [i.e., Jerusalem, which is founded on the mountains].
32:23	I will join evils [i.e., evil upon evil] upon them. I will end [all of] My arrows in them (— but they themselves will not end)].
32:24	(They will be) hairy with hunger and embattled by reshef [demons] and cut down by Meriri [a demon]. And the tooth of beasts will I send against them [(as it, indeed, happened, that the bite of lambs caused death)], with the venom of the crawlers in the dust [i.e., the serpents].
32:25	On the outside [of the city] the sword [of legions] shall devour [them], and in the chambers [of their hearts, when they flee], fright [will pound, eventually killing them], both young man and virgin, suckling and the man of gray hairs.
32:26	I said: I would disclaim them; I would cut off their remembrance from men,
32:27	Were it not that the anger of the foe were stored up [against them to destroy them. And if they did destroy them, they would attribute the victory to themselves and to their gods, and not to Me] — lest their oppressors estrange [i.e., lest they attribute their triumph to a stranger], lest they say: Our hand is exalted, and it is not the L rd who has wrought all this.
32:28	For it [the foe] is a nation devoid of counsel, and there is no understanding in them, [for]
32:39	If they were wise, they would understand this, they would comprehend their [Israel's] end [i.e., their defeat (as the L rd's doing and not as theirs).For they would say]
32:30	How could one [of us] pursue a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, if their Rock had not sold them, and the L rd (had not) delivered them [into our hands]!
32:31	[They should understand this, knowing from past experience] that not as our Rock is their rock, ["their rock" having been entirely powerless against ours], and [now] our foes judge [us! It must be, then, that our Rock has sold us.]
32:32	["I said I would disclaim them, etc." (26)], for of the wine of Sodom is their wine, and of the fields of Amorah [i.e., their deeds are those of Sodom and Amorah.] Their grapes are grapes of gall. Bitter clusters are their desert [for their "bitter" deeds].
32:33	The [bitter] venom of snakes is their wine [of retribution] and the cruel gall of asps [is their cup. A cruel foe will come and exact punishment of them].
32:34	[They think I have forgotten their deeds, but] is it ["the fruit of their wine and the produce of their fields" (see 32)] not laid up with Me and sealed in My stores!
32:35	With Me is [readied] vengeance, and it shall pay them [in accordance with their deeds] at the time their foot gives way [i.e., when they exhaust the merit of their fathers, which is their support]. For readied is the day of their calamity, and what is destined [for them] shall quickly befall them. [(Thus far, Moses' words of chastisement, the song to serve as witness, when retribution comes upon them, that he had forewarned them. There follow his words of consolation, relating to what will befall them after their punishment has been exacted (see 30:1-2)]
32:36	When the L rd has judged His people [with the aforementioned afflictions], and He repents Himself of His servants, [turning to be merciful to them], seeing that the hand [of the foe] is becoming progressively stronger, and that they (Israel) are bereft of [saving] restraint or strengthening,
32:37	Then He will say [about them]: Where are their gods? The rock in whom they sought shelter,
32:38	who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their libations? Let them arise and aid you! Let him [the "rock"] be covert for you!
32:39	See, now, [from the retribution that I brought upon you and from which none could save you, and from the salvation that I shall bring you, from which none can deter Me], that it is I [for "lowering," and] I [for "lifting"], and there is no god against Me [to deter Me]. I put to death and I bring to life, I smite and I heal, and there is no saving [those who sin against Me] from My hand.
32:40	For [in My wrath] I shall raise My hand [in oath] to heaven [i.e., to Myself], and I shall say: As I live forever,
32:41	I shall whet the flash of My sword and My hand shall take hold of justice, [abandoning mercy for My foes — "for I was wroth (against Israel) but little, and they (Israel's foes) 'assisted' in evil" (Zechariah 1:15)]; I shall return vengeance to My adversaries, and I shall repay those who hate Me.
32:42	I will make My arrows drunk with blood [of the nations], and My sword shall eat [their] flesh, [this, in retribution] for the blood of [Israel's] slain and [their] captivity, [in retribution] for [the sins of] the beginning of the breaches of the foe. [(When the Holy One Blessed be He exacts punishment of the nations, He visits upon them their sins and those of their forefathers, from the very beginning of the breach that they made in Israel.)]
32:43	[At that time] the nations will praise His people [for cleaving to Him in all of their vicissitudes and not forsaking Him, knowing His goodness and His glory]. For, the [shedding of the] blood of His servants shall He avenge, and vengeance shall He return to His adversaries [for their despoiling of Israel], and He will conciliate His land [and] His people [for the suffering they endured and for what the foe did to them. (When His people are consoled, His land is consoled.)]
32:44	And Moses came and he spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Hoshea the son of Nun. [Moses invested Joshua with the authority to expound in his (Moses') lifetime in order to raise his stature in the eyes of Israel (but Joshua, nonetheless, persisted in his humility, this, the signification of the reversion to "Hoshea" here, after he had already been granted the eminence of Yehoshua")].
32:45	And Moses finished speaking all of these things to all of Israel.
32:46	And he said to them: Put your hearts to all of these things which I place as testimony in you this day, which you shall command your children to keep and to do — all the words of this Torah.
32:47	For it is not an empty thing for you [Not in vain do you toil in it; great reward inheres in it]; for it is your life, and by this thing you shall prolong days on the land whither you cross over the Jordan to inherit it.
32:48	And the L rd spoke to Moses on this very day [(in the middle of the day, so that no one could later say that had he known of it, he would have prevented Moses' departure)] saying:
32:49	Go up to this Mount Avarim, Mount Nevo, which is in the land of Moav, facing Jericho, and see the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel as a holding.
32:50	And die on the mountain which you are ascending, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died [(i.e., with the same kind of death that you witnessed, and which you longed for)], in Hor Hahar, and he was gathered to his people.
32:51	("And die") because of your having trespassed against Me [i.e., because of your having led to a trespass against Me] in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Merivath Kadesh in the desert of Tzin, because of your not having sanctified Me [i.e., because of your having led to My not being sanctified] in the midst of the children of Israel [see Numbers 20:12].
32:52	For from afar shall you see the land, [for I know that it is beloved by you], but there you shall not come [(If you do not see it now, you will not see it at all — wherefore I tell you: "Go up … and see, etc."] — to the land that I give to the children of Israel.
Berachah
33
33:1	And this is the blessing wherewith Moses the man of G d blessed the children of Israel [immediately] before his death ["If not now, when!"]
33:2	And he said [(Moses opens with praise of the L rd and then with the requirements of Israel, Israel's merits inhering in the L rd's praise)]: The L rd came from Sinai [(He went out towards them when they came to stand at the foot of the mountain, as a groom goes out towards his bride)], and He shone forth from Seir to them, [after having first offered the Torah to the sons of Esav, (the inhabitants of Seir), who refused it]. He appeared from Mount Paran [after offering it to the children of Yishmael, who refused it]. And He came [to Israel, and with Him] some of the ten thousands of His holy [angels — and not even the greater part (as opposed to the ways of men of flesh and blood, who parade all of their wealth and glory on their nuptial day)]; from His right hand [i.e., In the tablets written by His right hand, He gave] them the law of fire [i.e., the Law which was written of yore before Him in black fire on white fire].
33:3	He also fondly loved the peoples [i.e., the tribes]; all of his holy ones are in Your hand [i.e., the souls of his righteous ones are secreted with You.], and [they are worthy of this, for at Mount Sinai] they placed themselves in the midst, at Your feet. They took upon themselves Your commandments.
33:4	The Torah which Moses commanded unto us is the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob [(We have possessed it and will not abandon it.)]
33:5	And He was a king in Yeshurun [i.e., the yoke of His kingdom was upon them] whenever their complement was assembled, the tribes of Israel together, [i.e., when there is peace (and not discord) among them].
33:6	Reuven shall live [in this world] and he shall not die [in the world to come (The episode of Bilhah (Genesis 352) will not be "brought up" to him)], and his men will be counted [among those of his brothers].
33:7	And this, [i.e., the same,] for Yehudah, [both Reuven and Yehudah having confessed for their misdeed (see Genesis 38:26)]. And he said: Hear, O L rd, the voice of Yehudah [i.e., the prayers of Yehudah's descendants: those of David, Solomon, and Assa vis-à-vis the Kushites, those of Yehoshafat vis-à-vis the Ammonites, and those of Chizkiah vis-à-vis Sancheriv.], and to his people shall You bring him [in peace from battle]. His hands will fight [his battle and take vengeance] for him, and You shall be a help against his foes [(this, in respect to Yehoshafat in the war of Ramoth Gilead)].
33:8	And of Levi he said: Your Thumim and Your Urim to Your (acknowledged) pious one, whom You proved in Massah, [Levi not caviling like the others], whom You tested at the waters of Merivah,
33:9	who says [(in the episode of the golden calf, when Levi was commanded to kill those who had served it)] of his father [i.e., his mother's father (the tribe of Levi not having sinned)] and of his mother: I have not seen them; and his brothers [i.e., his maternal brothers (by an Israelite)] he did not recognize, and his sons [i.e., his daughter's sons (by an Israelite)] he did not know. For they kept Your commandment ["You shall have no other gods"], and Your covenant [of circumcision] they kept [(the Levites, unlike the other tribes, having circumcised their sons in the desert)].
33:10	They shall teach Your judgments to Jacob [(they are worthy of doing so)], and Your Torah to Israel. They shall place incense before You and a burnt-offering upon Your altar.
33:11	Bless, O L rd, his substance, and desire the work of his hands. Break the thighs of those who rise up against him, and of his foes, that they rise not.
33:12	[The rationale of the juxtaposition: The blessing of Levi is the sacrificial service and that of Binyamin, the building of the Temple in his portion. Joseph follows (13) in that the sanctuary of Shiloh was built in his portion (but Binyamin takes precedence in that the Temple was more beloved than the sanctuary.)] Of Binyamin he said: Beloved of the L rd; he shall rest securely upon Him. He hovers over it [the Temple, protecting it] the entire day [i.e., forever (Once Jerusalem was selected, the Shechinah did not repose itself in a different place)]; and between his shoulders [(in a slight depression on the highest part of Binyamin's land)] does it (the Temple) rest.
33:13	And of Joseph he said: Blessed of the L rd is his land, [his being the choicest of the land of all the tribes]: of the sweet things of the heaven, of the dew, and of the deep, lying below, [the deep rising and watering it from below (see Genesis 49:25). With all of the tribes, the blessing of Moses was reminiscent of that of Jacob].
33:14	And of the sweet things brought forth by the sun, [Joseph's land being "open" to the sun, which sweetened the fruits], and of the sweet things [like melons] quickened by the moon,
33:15	And of the first [-ripened fruits] of the mountains of "yore" [(the mountains being earliest to ripen the fruits)], and of the sweet things of the eternal hills [i.e., hills which are "eternally" fruitful, never lacking rain],
33:16	And of the sweet things of the earth and its fullness, and (of) the favor of the Dweller [who first appeared to me] in the bush (Exodus 3:2). May it [this blessing] come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the head of him sundered [from] his brothers.
33:17	The grandeur [and kingdom] of his "ox" [(Joshua, who comes from Joseph and who conquered many kings)] is accorded him [see Numbers 27:20], and the horns of a re'em are his horns [i.e., they are as strong as those of an ox and beautiful as those of a re'em]. With them he shall gore peoples as one, the ends of the earth [i.e., thirty-one kings from the ends of the earth, (Eretz Yisrael being so desirable that there was no king who did not establish a seat in it)]. And they [the "gored ones"] are the ten thousands of Ephraim [i.e., those slain by Joshua, who came from Ephraim], and they are the thousands of Menasheh [i.e., those slain by Gideon in Midian (Judges 8:10)].
33:18	[The names of each of the last five tribes is "doubled" in the blessing in order to "strengthen" them, these being the weakest of all the tribes (which Joseph presented to Pharaoh. See Genesis 47:2)] And of Zevulun he said: Rejoice Zevulun in your going forth [in ships to trade], and Yissachar [learning] in your tents [of Torah, (Zevulun, through their support, enabling Yissachar to do so, for which reason Zevulun is mentioned first)].
33:19	Peoples [of the tribes of Israel] at the mountain [Mount Moriah] they [Yissachar, by being the "decisors" of the festival times (see I Chronicles 12:33)] will assemble. There they will sacrifice offerings of righteousness. For the abundance of the seas will they [Yissachar and Zevulun] suck, [giving them leisure for Torah study], and the covered things hidden in the sand [(valuable things found in the sea and the sand in the territory of Yissachar and Zevulun)].
33:20	And of Gad he said: Blessed is He that broadens Gad, [the territory of Gad broadening out eastward]. As a lion he dwells, [(border dwellers requiring the "strength of a lion" to repel invaders)], and he tore the arm together with the crown [Gad's slain ones were conspicuous — they hacked off head and arm at one blow.]
33:21	And he saw [fit to take] for himself [a portion in the land of Sichon and Og, which is the] first [of the conquest of Eretz Yisrael]. For [he knew that] there [in his territory] the [burial] plot of the lawgiver [Moses] is hidden [from all men (see 34:6)]. And he [Gad] went out at the head of the people [i.e., the vanguard of the army (in the conquest of the land), their men being warriors (Joshua 1:14)]. He did the righteousness of the L rd and His judgments with Israel, [keeping their word to cross over the Jordan (and not to return) until their brethren had conquered and apportioned the land.]
33:22	And of Dan he said: Dan is a lion's whelp [(Dan, too, was close to the border)]; he shall leap forth from the Bashan [(The Jordan issued forth from the Bashan in the territory of Dan.)]
33:23	And of Naftali he said: [The land of] Naftali sates the desire [of all its inhabitants], and it is full of the blessing of the L rd — Inherit the sea [of Kinnereth] and the south [(Naftali received a rope-length of fishing coast in its south)].
33:24	And of Asher he said: Blessed with sons is Asher [more than all of the other tribes]. He shall be ingratiating to his brothers [by supplying them with oil and fine fruits (and they to him, by supplying him with grain)], and he shall steep his foot in oil [(his land drawing oil like a well)].
33:25	[And now Moses speaks of all of Israel:] Iron and copper are your locks, [the warriors of Israel being stationed in the border cities and "locking out" invaders]; and as [blessed as] the days [of your youth will be the days of] your old age.
33:26	[Know,] Yeshurun, [that] there is none like the Almighty [among all the gods of the peoples]. The Rider in the heavens [— He is the G d who] is your help; and in His pride [He rides] the skies,
33:27	[which He chose] as an abode for the G d of yore [i.e., the G d who preceded all others], and beneath [the skies] (trembling beneath Him) are the [strong] arms of the world, [viz., Sichon and Og, the kings of Canaan, who were the "might" of the world]. And He drove out the foe before you, and He said [to you]: Destroy [them]!
33:28	And Israel dwelt secure, alone, [each one under his vine and under his fig tree, scattered, not needing to dwell together in fear of the enemy], as [in the blessing of] Jacob [(Genesis 48:21), G d bringing them] to a land of corn and wine. His heavens, too, shall drip dew, [as in the blessing of Isaac (Genesis 27:28)].
33:29	[(Moses now says:) Why need I enumerate details? Everything is yours!] Happy are you, O Israel! Who is like you? A people helped by the L rd, the Shield of your salvation and the Sword of your pride! Your foes will dissimulate to you [in fear of you, viz. the Giveonites (Joshua 9:9)], and you will tread on their high places [viz. Ibid. 10:24)].
34
34:1	And Moses went up [in one bound] from the plains of Moav to Mount Nevo, the top of the height which faces Jericho, and the L rd showed him all of the land [(He showed him all of Eretz Yisrael in its (time of) peace, and the oppressors who were destined to rise up against it)], the Gilead until Dan [(He showed him the sons of Dan serving idolatry (Judges 18:30), and He showed him Shimshon, of the tribe of Dan, who would arise as a savior.)]
34:2	And all of Naftali [(He showed him his land in its peace and in its ruin, and He showed him Barak and Devorah of Kedesh-Naftali warring with Sisra and his hosts)], and the land of Ephraim and Menasheh [(He showed him their land in its peace and in its ruin, and He showed him Joshua, who came from Ephraim, warring with the kings of Canaan; and Gideon, who came from Menasheh, warring with Midian and Amalek)], and all the land of Yehudah [(in its peace and in its ruin; and He showed him the Davidic kingdom and its triumph)], until the western sea [(in its peace and in its ruin)].
34:3	And the southland and the plain [of the Jordan. He showed him Solomon casting the Temple vessels (viz. I Kings 7:46)], the valley of Jericho, the city of palms, until Tzoar.
34:4	And the L rd said to him: This is the land that I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; I have shown it to you before your eyes [so that you go to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob] and say [to them]: To your seed shall I give it [i.e., I have fulfilled My oath]; but [it is a decree before Me that] there you shall not pass over [(Otherwise, I would have kept you alive until you saw them planted and settled there, to go and tell the patriarchs of it)]
34:5	[(Up to this point, Moses wrote; from this point on, Joshua wrote.)] And Moses died there, the servant of the L rd, in the land of Moav, by the word of the L rd.
34:6	And He [Himself] buried him in the valley in the land of Moav opposite Beth-Peor [(His grave had been readied there from the six days of creation to atone for the sin of Peor)]; and no man knew his grave, until this very day.
34:7	And Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died; his eye did not dim [even after he died], and his sap did not flee [(He did not decompose and his lineaments did not change)].
34:8	And the children of Israel [(the men)] mourned Moses in the plains of Moav thirty days [(whereas Aaron, who had pursued peace between man and his neighbor and man and his wife, was mourned by "all the house of Israel," men and women (Numbers 20:29)]; and the days of the weeping of the mourning of Moses ended.
34:9	And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had placed his hands upon him; and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and they did as the L rd had commanded Moses.
34:10	And there arose no other prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the L rd knew face to face [i.e., Moses being "familiar" with the L rd, speaking with Him whenever he desired]
34:11	In all the signs and the wonders which the L rd sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all of his servants, and to all of his land,
34:12	And in all the strong hand [of Moses that received the Torah on the tablets], and in all the great awe, [the miracles and the mighty acts in the great, awesome desert] that Moses wrought before the eyes of all Israel, [his venturing to break the tablets before their eyes (viz. 9:17) — and the L rd concurring in his resolution!]
